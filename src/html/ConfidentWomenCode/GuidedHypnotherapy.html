    <p><strong>Coach (calm, soothing voice):</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome.</p>
    <p>Today, you’re stepping into a space of deep relaxation and profound connection where your future empowered self awaits to meet you.</p>
    <p>Take a slow, deep breath in... and let it go with ease.</p>
    <p>Feel your body soften, your mind slow, and your heart open.</p>
    <p>With each breath, you sink deeper into calm... deeper into safety... deeper into yourself.</p>
    
    <p>Now, imagine in front of you a soft, glowing light—warm and inviting, like a sunrise.</p>
    <p>This light is a portal—a doorway to your future self. The woman you are becoming, radiant with strength, clarity, and purpose.</p>
    <p>Step through this light and see her waiting for you.</p>
    
    <p>Notice how she stands—tall, grounded, and relaxed.</p>
    <p>Feel the energy she carries a magnetic, quiet power that draws you in.</p>
    <p>She smiles warmly, eyes full of love and knowing.</p>
    
    <p>This woman has walked the path you are on, faced the fears, and stepped boldly into her truth.</p>
    <p>Now, hear her voice as she speaks to you words meant just for your soul:</p>
    <p><em>“You are whole. You are worthy. All the power you seek has always lived inside you. Trust your journey. Trust your heart. I am here with you—always.”</em></p>
    
    <p>Feel her energy flow into you now, like a wave of light filling every cell.</p>
    <p>Feel your confidence deepen, your clarity sharpen, your courage ignite.</p>
    <p>Take a moment to sit with this feeling your empowered self is alive within you, ready to guide and support you.</p>
    <p>When you’re ready, gently bring your awareness back to your breath.</p>
    <p>Feel your body in this space.</p>
    <p>Wiggle your fingers and toes.</p>
    <p>And when it feels right, open your eyes.</p>
    <p>Carry this knowing with you your empowered self is always with you, a source of light and strength.</p>
    <p>Thank you for showing up to this moment of transformation.</p>

    <h3>Practice: Your Empowered Woman Declaration</h3>
    <p>This is where it all comes together.</p>
    <p>You’ve done the work. You’ve looked within, peeled back the layers, met your truth, and reclaimed so many parts of yourself.</p>
    <p>Now—it’s time to own who you’re becoming. With your words. With your presence. With your voice.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just about writing something down. It’s about declaring—out loud—the woman you now choose to be.</p>
    <p><strong>What is a Declaration?</strong></p>
    <p>It’s not a script. It’s not a slogan. It’s your truth, spoken with heart.</p>
    <p>This is your <em> "I’m no longer hiding"</em> moment.</p>
    <p>Your <em>“this is who I am now”</em> moment.</p>
    <p>It’s a living statement that reflects your values, your boundaries, your voice, and your vision.</p>
    <p>It’s who you are when you stop shrinking and start showing up fully.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="image-section">
            <img src="/src/img/banner.jpg" alt="Laying the Foundation Image" /></div>
  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>Step One: Reflect + Write</h4>
    <p>Take a breath. Put your hand on your heart. Feel into these questions—not from your head, but from your body.</p>
    <p>Let your truth rise up from your chest, your belly, your bones.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who am I when I’m not trying to prove or perform?</li>
      <li>What do I now stand for without apology?</li>
      <li>What have I outgrown?</li>
      <li>What am I ready to fully claim?</li>
      <li>What kind of woman do I want to be... when no one’s watching?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now start to shape your answers into a declaration something you can read, say, feel. It might sound like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “I am a woman who trusts herself even when it’s hard. I no longer wait to be chosen. I choose me. I speak with clarity. I lead with love. I take up space without guilt. My power is not a performance—it’s who I am when I’m rooted and real.”
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>There’s no right or wrong here. Just your truth.</p>
  
  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>Step Two: Speak It</h4>
    <p>Once you’ve written your declaration, take it to the mirror. Look yourself in the eyes.</p>
    <p>Yes it might feel awkward. That’s okay. This isn’t about sounding perfect. It’s about being real.</p>
    <p>Read it slowly. Out loud. Let the words land in your body. Let yourself feel what you’re saying.</p>
    <p>Speak like you believe it… even if your voice shakes a little. (Especially if your voice shakes a little.)</p>
    <p>You’re reprogramming something deep here.</p>
      </div>
  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>Step Three: Keep It Close</h4>
    <p>This declaration isn’t a one-time thing.</p>
    <p>Stick it on your mirror. Make it the lock screen on your phone. Read it every morning before your day begins. Speak it when you feel doubt creeping back in.</p>
    <p>Let this be your anchor the thing that reminds you of who you are when the world tries to make you forget.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-box">
    <h4>A Loving Reminder</h4>
    <p>You don’t need to become someone else. You’re not creating a new identity. You’re remembering the woman you’ve always been—before the world told you to be smaller, quieter, nicer.</p>
    <p>Now… you get to decide.</p>
    <p>Who are you when you trust yourself? Who are you when you stop waiting? Who are you when you finally, finally speak your truth?</p>
    <p>Write that woman into existence. Then go live her. One breath, one word, one bold moment at a time.</p>
