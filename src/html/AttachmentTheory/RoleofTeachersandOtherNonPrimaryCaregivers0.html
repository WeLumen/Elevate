            <h2>Lesson 2: Role of Teachers and Other Non-Primary Caregivers</h2>

            <p>Now that we have learnt about the ways in which adults can generally support children in developing more secure attachment styles, let's discuss some of the specific types of adults- aside from primary caregivers-who may be involved in the emotional coaching and support of children as they grow up.</p>

<h2>TEACHERS</h2>
<p>Teachers are usually the adults who are around children the most, aside from their family or caregivers, so they can play a vital role in modelling emotions and offering support or coaching around emotional regulation.</p>
<p>They can also observe children's attachment-related behaviours and talk to parents about ways they can coordinate support for children to develop a more secure attachment style.</p>
<p>Especially during pre-school or nursery school, and the early years of primary school, teachers are not only teaching the basics of reading, math, science, and art, but they tend to involve social skills and emotionally regulating activities in their daily curriculum. Children with insecure attachments can either struggle or shine in these situations, but the clues are usually there somewhere in their behaviours.</p>
<p>Too often, teachers are saddled with class sizes so large that they struggle to offer such tailored attention and coaching to each individual child. Their focus is first and foremost academic education, to be sure, but many teachers are also skilled emotional coaches who simply don't have the bandwidth to emotionally support and observe so many children at once with so little support and resources.</p>

<h2>HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS</h2>
<p>During routine check-ups, vaccinations, and other situations, babies and young children frequently show pretty extreme attachment traits due to the stress of a new environment and scary physical sensations. This puts healthcare providers in a unique position to observe children without spending regular time around them, which is helpful because they are sometimes in a position of equal or greater authority to the caregiver. Doctors may have an easier time approaching parents about concerns than a teacher or a nurse, for instance.</p>
<p>Increasingly, paediatricians are attempting to approach behavioural problems with coaching or referrals to a counsellor instead of medicating young children, and attachment theory often plays a role in the way these treatments are applied. In addition, parents are often given some degree of instruction and support surrounding how to form secure attachments with their babies during the first year of life.</p>

<h2>INTERVENTION IN CASES OF POTENTIAL ABUSE</h2>
<p>Because attachment wounds can be the result of caregiver abuse, other adults in a child's life may be understandably concerned if they notice insecure attachment behaviour. Whether to report or not is a difficult decision-and, sometimes, it is not even a decision that is in the hands of the person reporting.</p>
<p>In some countries, teachers and other professionals who work with children are called 'mandated reporters' and must legally report any suspicious behaviour. In the United Kingdom, this is currently only statutory guidance for teachers, not a robustly enforceable law. Social workers and healthcare workers are both legally compelled to report any suspicion of child abuse to the proper authorities, though.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL WORKERS AND COUNSELLORS</h2>
<p>If a child is involved with any social programme, or has been enrolled in mental health counselling, the social workers, therapists, counsellors, specialists, and other professionals in the public sector are frequently versed in basic attachment theory and tasked with making sure children feel safe and adequately cared for in their home situation. Social workers can intervene in cases of abuse, and also help families deal with material shortfalls to decrease the pressure to neglect the child.</p>
<p>Therapists are great resources for learning emotional regulation and can help children deal with any early life trauma that may be contributing to insecure attachment.</p>

<h2>CHANGEABLE PATTERNS, NOT PATHOLOGIES</h2>
<p>Now that you have learnt about the different kinds of adults who may support children through the lens of attachment theory, let's discuss how this theory is most effectively applied and understood when it comes to mental health.</p>

<h2>ATTACHMENT STYLES ARE FLUID</h2>
<p>Attachment styles can and do change over the course of a lifetime, and people can learn to be securely attached later in life. As with any behaviour or pattern-based classification, it is something that can be recognised, addressed, and modified. This might require digging deep into early childhood trauma, or just lots of uncomfortable emotional effort, but no attachment style is fixed or forever.</p>
<p>Even securely attached adults can become insecurely attached with sufficient attachment wounding.</p>
<p>Throughout this course, we have referenced some links between mental health diagnoses and different insecure attachment styles.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that these links are correlative -or mutually related-and not causative. Having an insecure attachment style is not a mental illness, nor does it necessitate that the individual will develop a mental illness.</p>
<p>Attachment theory is best understood, not as a pathology, but as a way to understand patterns of over-use of ineffective coping mechanisms. By teaching children to recognise these patterns in themselves and giving them tools to cope with their emotions or change their behaviours, adults can empower them to live healthy, fulfilling lives.</p>
