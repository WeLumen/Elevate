            <h2>Lesson 2: Erik Erikson's Research </h2>

            <h3>INFLUENCE OF FREUD'S PERSONALITY THEORIES</h3>
<p>Two well-known theories of development are Sigmund Freud's psychosexual theory and Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory. Whilst Erikson's theory was informed by Freud's views, it diverged in a number of key areas.</p>
<p>Erikson, like Freud, acknowledged the significance of the unconscious in development. He also felt that personality evolves through a succession of phases. Unlike Freud's psychosexual phases theory, Erikson's approach considers the influence of social experiences throughout one's life.</p>
<p>The developmental ramifications of this scenario might be explained using two fundamental psychoanalytic theories on human development: the theory presented by Sigmund Freud called the psychosexual theory or the one presented by Erikson called the psychosocial theory. We'll look at what these two ideas do have in common and also how they vary in this module.</p>
<p>Erikson's thesis was founded on many of Freud's concepts and followed in his footsteps. As a result, there are similarities between the two hypotheses. The unconscious plays an important role in growth, according to both thinkers. They also use comparable age categorisations for the developmental phases and divide growth into phases of a person's life.</p>
<p>There are, however, numerous distinctions between the titles of the phases and the developmental challenges that each stage encounters. Erik Erikson is among the few Western personality theorists who have covered the full lifespan. He moved away from Freud's focus on psychosexual tensions and toward psychosocial crises, which appear in different ways throughout maturity and older life. Erikson's idea has always been prominent, but as our civilisation has gotten older, the need to comprehend the elderly has risen, making Erikson's viewpoint much more essential and pertinent than when he initially suggested it. If Erikson's viewpoint on personality changes in maturity and old age proves to be more relevant over time, it might lead to an intriguing shift in Erikson's status in psychology.</p>
<p>One reason for this diversity is because each psychologist has their own unique perspective on what determines a person's growth. The relevance of basic wants and biological forces is emphasised in Freud's psychosexual theory, whereas Erikson's psychosocial theory is more centred on social and environmental elements. Erikson's theory also extends into maturity, whereas Freud's theory concludes at a younger age.</p>

<h2>INFLUENCE OF FREUD'S PERSONALITY THEORIES</h2>
<p>Although Erikson is included in most personality textbooks and is often covered in lifetime developmental literature as well, he is not addressed in most 'history of psychology' books, and those that do discuss him do so only very briefly. As popular as he is among psychology students and most psychology teachers, being a regular subject in the history of his discipline would be a remarkable honour.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Erikson was first and primarily a psychoanalyst, namely a child psychoanalyst. In pursuing the psychological changes that follow ageing, he did not overlook the relevance of childhood.</p>
<p>One can look through book after book on history, culture, and ethics and find little mention of the fact that everyone starts as a child and that everyone starts in their nursery. Having a lengthy childhood is human; having an even longer childhood is civilised. Yet, whilst a long childhood develops a person's technical and cerebral virtuosity, it also leaves them with a lifetime of emotional immaturity.</p>
<p>H. Scudder and Alfred Kroeber, two anthropologists who had been researching the Sioux and Yurok tribes, were instrumental in introducing Erikson to them. Erikson was able to earn the trust of the individual Sioux and Yurok via this introduction, and they gave Erikson significant data on their traditional ways of living and child-rearing techniques.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, though, that Native Americans were not the only cultural groups Erikson looked at. In an attempt to comprehend the horrible political events that transpired in Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, he examined Hitler's childhood myths and Maxim Gorky's childhood myths.</p>
<p>He also looked at the elements that influence Black identity in the United States. After the Civil War ended slavery, Erikson stated that one of the biggest problems for Black people in the US was the generally broken hope of a better quality of life. Even in the North, bigotry and racism persisted as they transitioned from their actual identity as slaves to a fractured one as ostensibly free people.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Erikson drew several fascinating similarities between Black people and Native Americans in terms of their struggles to find their place in American society, which emphasises his work on culture and development.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<p>Erikson had a view that there were eight distinct stages that defined human development, from childhood to maturity. At each stage, the individual experiences a psychological crisis, which can have a positive or negative influence on their personal growth.</p>
<p>These crises, according to Erikson, are psychosocial in character because they include individual psychological demands (i.e. psycho) colliding with societal requirements (i.e. social).</p>
<p>According to the concept, successfully completing each phase leads to the development of a good sense of identity and the realisation of fundamental values. Basic virtues are intrinsic traits that the ego may call upon in the face of future crises.</p>
<p>Failure to finish a stage effectively can lead to a lower capacity to complete subsequent phases, as well as a more disorganised character and sense of identity. These stages, on the other hand, can be effectively handled at a later date.</p>
