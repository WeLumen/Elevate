            <h2>Lesson 2: Useful Applications of Attachment Theory</h2>
            <p>Now that we have learnt about the criticisms of attachment theory</p>
<p>Let's go over some of the more practical and helpful applications of these ideas with these limitations in mind. Despite the shortcomings, attachment theory concepts can still be effective tools for teachers, counsellors, and conflict mediators to consider in certain situations.</p>

<h2>TEACHERS</h2>
<p>Teachers might not get the most value out of trying to categorise and identify each student's specific attachment style; instead, they may find it effective to view individual relationships or student interactions through the lens of aiming for securely attached behaviours. This allows them to focus on the productive parts of attachment theory without getting so bogged down.</p>
<p>In particular, approaching the discipline of students with an understanding of how certain approaches may be less effective in building a secure attachment style within the student-teacher interaction can be very helpful. Instead of using techniques that get short-term results and allow the teacher to continue their lesson, they might want to take the time to problem-solve or sit down and emotionally coach students who act out frequently in class. Instead of writing these children off as problems or having their own emotional response to the behaviours, attempting to build better rapport and trust with students through the perspective of attachment theory may Previous Lesson Part 1: Criticisms of Attachment Theory help them to reach and support more of the children in their classes.</p>

<h2>CONFLICT MEDIATION</h2>
<p>Because attachment theory is all about the behaviour of children and caregivers in stressful situations, it can certainly be helpful for professionals and laypersons alike who are trying to help a young person and their caregiver mediate a conflict—this includes parents trying to de-escalate or resolve a conflict with their own child. It can also be a helpful tool for reflection in other relationships, though the specifics can get a bit strange when one refers to the original Ainsworth and Bowlby theories and tries to apply them to relationships that don't fit neatly into any of the prescribed categories.</p>
<p>Once again, it is more useful to try to understand specific instances of conflict instead of labelling each individual as having a fixed attachment style that needs 'fixing.' An instance in which attachment theory may be useful to consider is as follows: A child and her mother are in conflict because the child screams and throws a fit whenever she knows she is going to have to go to pre-school or day-care, and the mother has been advised to try to ignore the fits until they calm instead of responding. However, this elevates her own anxiety more, and sometimes she lashes out in frustration by yelling at her child to calm down.</p>
<p>Using attachment theory as a moderate tool, it may be easier to understand that the child is seeking reassurance and comfort in a way that fits an ambivalent attachment style, and that all of the ways in which the parent is currently responding will likely only make things worse.</p>

<h2>MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS</h2>
<p>Additionally, attachment theory can be a helpful tool for thinking about and processing childhood trauma—which is why many mental health professionals haven't entirely tossed it in the bin. Some of the concepts that attachment theory relies on can help to explain likely mechanisms for maladaptive coping mechanisms and unwanted behaviour patterns, but most providers find other theories are more widely applicable to understanding these issues. To be sure, someone who is experiencing every relationship in their life with insecure attachment patterns might need some support in developing and improving their mental health, but most providers are moving away from using these styles as diagnostic tools.</p>
