            <h2>Lesson 2: Other Presentations of Avoidant Attachment</h2>

            <h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT IN ADULTS</h3>
<p>
Now that we have learnt all about the characteristics, over the lifespan, of a person experiencing avoidant attachment style, let's discuss some more of the psychological analysis involved in understanding these individuals.
</p>

<h2>TRAUMA RESPONSES</h2>
<p>
Recent advances in neurobiology and psychology have led to a much more complex understanding of the brain than we had when attachment theory was originally developed. One of these developments has been a broadened understanding and definition of trauma. Trauma is understood as the response to a deeply distressing event or circumstance, which overwhelms the individual's ability to cope and maintain normal functioning.
</p>
<p>
Whilst the trauma label used to more exclusively be applied to violent physical experiences or witnessing violence, recent studies have shown that intense emotional experiences (especially in early childhood) function in a very similar way to the physically violent ones. Therefore, many family psychologists and other providers who treat children take a trauma-informed approach to understanding the attachment style of their clients.
</p>

<h2>TRAUMA-INFORMED PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<p>
There are four main trauma responses that psychologists have identified: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. Avoidant attachment style is heavily associated with the 'flight' trauma response, which does not necessitate physical flight. Children frequently do not have the option to physically leave distressing situations, so they may 'flee' the experience emotionally, retreating inward or focusing on a distracting activity with little emotional effect.
</p>
<p>
Some children with avoidant attachment styles are also prone to running away, hiding from caregivers, or truancy from school. As adults, the freedom to physically leave situations may lead to a proclivity to isolation or withdrawal when feeling emotionally overwhelmed.
</p>

<h2>MENTAL HEALTH AND AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT STYLES</h2>
<p>
Now that we have examined the trauma-informed perspective on avoidant attachment styles, let's review the overall impacts on mental health that this kind of attachment behaviour and patterning can lead to.
</p>

<h2>DISORDERS RELATED TO CONTROL</h2>
<p>
Because children who develop an avoidant attachment style grow up without consistently caring responses from their parents and other caregivers, they have a high drive to control the circumstances and relationships in their own life. When they feel out of control and do not have many plausible options to resolve a particular situation, they may turn to maladaptive behaviours to regain a sense of order and independence.
</p>
<p>
One of these observed difficulties is the development of eating disorders, including anorexia and bulimia, as well as other forms of disordered or restrictive eating. Whilst many people have the mistaken impression that these disorders primarily arise from anxiety and shame around food and body image, some people who have few hang-ups about their body can still find themselves falling into these patterns because of their avoidant attachment tendencies.
</p>
<p>
In addition, issues related to self-harm, such as cutting, burning, hair pulling, skin picking, and other forms of self-mutilation, can be unhealthy coping mechanisms that this population turns to when they are feeling out of control. Again, the widespread misconception is that people who self-harm are suicidal or otherwise desire to seriously hurt their bodies. The fact is that many people cut or turn to other forms of self-harm to experience an extreme bodily sensation that they can entirely control. They often have preferred locations and methods so that the experience and outcome feel very reliable and predictable. In the face of emotional isolation and uncertainty, this ineffective behaviour can nonetheless feel very soothing in the moment.
</p>

<h2>DISORDERS RELATED TO EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION</h2>
<p>
Even though an avoidant attachment style can lead to an external presentation of high self-esteem and an easy-going demeanour, depression is common for those who live with this pattern. The lack of emotional intimacy can lead to difficulties in feeling or expressing joy or pleasure—and over time, that can become either a chronic Major Depression diagnosis or episodic periods of depressive states during more emotionally demanding times.
</p>
<p>
It's also worth noting that research has shown some interesting overlap in potential genetic factors that contribute to both personality disorder traits and insecure attachment styles. Research on the correlation between these two psychological diagnostic tools is difficult to differentiate because of the likely overlap in causation from biological sources, but there have certainly been some correlative observations about avoidant attachment style and disorders such as Avoidant Personality Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.
</p>

<h2>AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT IN ADULT RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>
Now that we have discussed the mental health impacts of an avoidant attachment style, let's review the ways that it can show up and interfere with adult relationships. In this section, we will primarily focus on and discuss sexual or romantic relationships but will include a short section on the impact on therapeutic relationships as well.
</p>

<h2>ROMANTIC AND SEXUAL PARTNERS</h2>
<p>
Because of their fierce independence and avoidance of emotional intimacy, these individuals can leave their romantic partners feeling abandoned even if they are still physically close. They are prone to sabotaging a relationship to get out of it; instead of communicating their desire to leave directly, they often wind up provoking partners to leave them.
</p>
<p>
Because they are typically 'solution oriented' and do not like to show signs of stress, their responses to their partner's distress can feel incredibly invalidating. They may even be apparently irritated or annoyed by the existence of stress or difficulty in the relationship and could run away at the first disagreement or difficulty.
</p>
<p>
On the flip-side—adults with avoidant attachment are usually pretty level-headed in a crisis, and they can be really fun to be around when emotions are light and pleasant. It's the development of trust and true intimacy that they struggle with, and they may avoid close connections entirely in order to skip the difficulty of developing trust with others.
</p>

<h2>IN THERAPY</h2>
<p>
Avoidant attachment can also interfere with relationships with therapists due to the desire to avoid and dissociate from emotional awareness. These individuals may even be inclined to avoid therapy altogether and typically struggle to build trust with new providers.
