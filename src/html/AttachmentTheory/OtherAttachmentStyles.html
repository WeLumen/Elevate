            <h2>Lesson 2: Other Attachment Styles</h2>

            <h3>AMBIVALENT OR ANXIOUS-PREOCCUPIED ATTACHMENT STYLE</h3>

<p>Now that we have examined avoidant attachment in adults, let's go over the characteristics of adults with an ambivalent attachment style.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DISPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVE</h3>
<p>These adults tend to have a negative view of themselves but usually have a generally positive view of the world around them. This gets a little tricky in regard to those who are closest to them, which we will discuss more in the next section. These adults may seek a lot of validation from those around them, whether in work, social, or home settings. Even with validation and appreciation, they tend to remain emotionally labile with a low self-esteem. Because ambivalent attachment is all about the contradictory behaviours of craving connection and being anxious about connection, they can often unknowingly give others an impression of emotional unreliability or unavailability. Adults with ambivalent attachment styles are often so caught up in their worries about what could happen that they struggle to enjoy the present moment. This preoccupation also impacts their relationships significantly.</p>

<h3>RELATIONSHIP BEHAVIOURS</h3>
<p>Adults with ambivalent attachment styles tend to anticipate rejection and require a lot of validation to feel safe and wanted in a relationship, especially romantic or other intimate relationships. The low self-esteem that characterises these individuals can lead to clingy behaviours or, conversely, anxious and jealous behaviours that push their partners away. Adults who have the specific resistant sub-type of ambivalent attachment style may also find themselves frequently angry and frustrated with those they are closest to, mirroring the relational patterns they likely experienced as children. Ambivalent attachment is often marked by this significant contradictory behaviour within close relationships but is distinguished from disorganised attachment in that adults with this attachment style have less of a contradictory internal perspective. They are being driven primarily by their desire for intimacy, and they are more prone to believing that even behaviours that may push partners away are towards that end. They are also more prone to be very dependent on their partners.</p>

<h2>DISORGANISED ATTACHMENT STYLE</h2>

<h3>GENERAL DISPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVE</h3>
<p>Disorganised attachment style often leads adults to present as inconsistent, both emotionally and behaviourally, and their dispositions may be somewhat chaotic. These individuals tend to struggle with emotional regulation-leading them to have mood swings that make it hard to focus on tasks or to endure stressful situations. They might also show some avoidant tendencies in their inclination to remove themselves or stay distant from difficult emotional situations. Adults with a disorganised attachment style usually have a negative self-perception combined with a negative perception of the world, which causes them to feel ill at ease, if not downright anxious, in most situations. They may struggle with identifying their own emotions or needs, and usually do not feel comfortable asking for help or support. These adults also may still come off as attention-seeking or dramatic to their peers, which is not helped by the difficulties they have regarding emotional perception and communication.</p>

<p>Unlike ambivalent attachment, disorganised attachment usually results in internal motivators that are at odds-resulting in even more contradictory behaviour. These adults usually want social connection and isolated independence with similar intensities, or varying intensities, which ebb and flow. This can lead to some very confusing behaviours in relationships.</p>

<h3>RELATIONSHIP BEHAVIOURS</h3>
<p>The lack of cohesion that defines the disorganised attachment style can wreak havoc upon intimate and romantic relationships, but it often does quite a bit of damage to casual interactions or friendships as well. Adults with this attachment style usually have a deep longing to belong to a group combined with the contradictory urge to dodge any future abandonments by retaining independence. Somewhat similarly to those with an avoidant attachment style, these people will usually avoid emotional closeness-the main difference is that adults with a disorganised attachment style do want to have intimate relationships, but their fear leads them to present with ambivalence. When they do begin to get close to others, they have extreme barriers to trust and often unintentionally sabotage or push away relationships. The two extremes of co-dependency and rigid independence can be confusing for partners to navigate, and their struggles with emotional identification and communication can compound these issues.</p>
