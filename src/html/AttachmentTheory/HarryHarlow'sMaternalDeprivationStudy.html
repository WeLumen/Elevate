            <h2>Lesson 3: Harry Harlow's Maternal Deprivation Study </h2>
            <p>In behavioural science, Harry Harlow's empirical work with monkeys is today regarded as a classic, altering our knowledge of the function of social bonds in early development.</p>

<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, behaviourists and psychoanalysts dominated psychological research in the United States, supporting the theory that new-borns became bonded to their mothers because the latter supplied sustenance.</p>

<p>This viewpoint, according to Harlow and other social and cognitive psychologists, ignores the value of comfort, friendship, and love in supporting healthy growth. Harlow demonstrated the influence of contact comfort on monkey development using isolation and mother deprivation approaches.</p>

<p>The experiment occurred by separating Rhesus monkeys from their mothers, as well as their companions, and they were instead put in cages to be observed in a controlled laboratory setting.</p>

<p>The monkeys displayed aberrant behaviour in social isolation, looking blankly, circling their cages, and self-mutilating. When the separated new-borns were reintroduced to the group, they were confused about how to engage with them, and many of them withdrew from the group, dying as a result of their refusal to feed.</p>

<p>Even when not completely separated from their mothers, the young monkeys acquired social deficiencies, exhibiting solitary inclinations and clutching to their cotton diapers. The new-borns' connection to the cloth diapers piqued Harlow's curiosity, and he hypothesised that the padding might mimic the comfort afforded by a mother's touch. Harlow based his now-famous surrogate mother's study on this discovery.</p>

<p>The experiment was conducted in a way that the monkeys were separated from their mothers and were then kept with so-called 'surrogate mothers'. One was made of wire and wood, and the other was made from terry cloth and foam rubber, which was much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The new-borns were randomly allocated to one of two groups. The first group had a wire mother with a bottle of milk and the second group's surrogate had food. The wire surrogate mother did not have food.</p>

<p>Harlow discovered that the new-born monkeys spent a substantially longer time with the terry cloth mother than with the wire mother in both scenarios. When the wire mother was the only one who had food, the infants went to her to nurse and then returned to the cloth surrogate.</p>

<p>When new-borns were presented with unfamiliar and frightening conditions, Harlow's research revealed that they resorted to inanimate surrogate mothers for solace. Infant monkeys that were placed in an unfamiliar setting with a surrogate mother would explore the area, hurry back to the surrogate mother when scared, and then go out to explore again.</p>

<p>If an unsettling noise-making object was placed in the cage—a new-born with a surrogate mother present would investigate and attack the object, but an infant without a surrogate mother would retreat and become immobilised with terror, gathered in a ball, and sucking their thumbs.</p>

<h2>Impact and Legacy of Attachment Theory</h2>

<p>This research combined to provide ground-breaking empirical evidence on the relevance of maternal touch in baby development and the priority of the parent-child attachment relationship. Harlow's insights continue to impact scientific knowledge of the basic components of human behaviour more than 70 years later.</p>

<p>Studies and work with abandoned, institutionalised, and foster children, as well as therapy work with mourning, suicide prevention, substance misuse, child abuse and neglect, extremism, and parenting, have all benefited from attachment theory research.</p>

<p>Researchers believe that a therapist's awareness of a child's insecure attachment, particularly in the field of social work, can help to build a stable relationship despite a history of unstable surroundings.</p>

<p>The idea that attachment patterns are based on a single element—caregiver deprivation—has been critiqued as being unduly broad since many children who grow up without conventional caregivers nonetheless grow in age-appropriate ways.</p>

<p>Bowlby also left out genetic influences, basing his hypothesis purely on this evolutionary requirement for connection, a move that drew criticism from scholars who believe personality is heritable.</p>
