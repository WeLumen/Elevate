            <h2>Lesson 1: Key Figures in Attachment Theory </h2>

            <p>To understand Attachment Theory, it helps to first look at some of the theories presented by the individuals who shaped this field: from the initial work of John Bowlby to the later works of Mary Ainsworth, who expanded on Bowlby's work. Harry Harlow is also a key name in the expansion of Attachment Theory.</p>

<h2>JOHN BOWLBY</h2>

<p>The first attachment theorist was the British psychologist John Bowlby, who defined attachment as "a persistent psychological closeness between human beings." Bowlby was interested in learning more about children's separation anxiety and suffering when they are away from their primary caregivers.</p>

<p>Attachment was once thought to be merely a taught habit, according to some of the first behavioural theories.. Attachment, according to these beliefs, is essentially the product of the child's feeding relationship with their caregiver. Because the caregiver feeds and nourishes the infant, the youngster develops a bond with them.</p>

<p>But, even feedings did not alleviate the fear that youngsters felt when they were away from their primary caregivers, according to Bowlby. Rather, he discovered that attachment was marked by distinct behavioural and motivational patterns. When youngsters are afraid, they will seek comfort and care from their primary caregiver by being close to them.</p>

<p>An emotional link with another person is known as attachment. John Bowlby suggested that the early relationship of a child with their carer has a big impact on their lives. According to Bowlby, having the infant close to herself, will also help increase the chances of survival of the mother.</p>

<p>Attachment, according to Bowlby, is a result of evolutionary processes. Bowlby and others believed that children are born with an inbuilt need to develop relationships with caregivers, contrary to behavioural theories of attachment that suggested attachment was a taught process.</p>

<h2>MARY AINSWORTH</h2>

<p>Bowlby's original work was substantially built upon by psychologist Mary Ainsworth in her 1970s research. Her seminal 'Strange Situation' study highlighted the powerful influence of attachment on behaviour.</p>

<p>Mary Ainsworth established three basic forms of attachment according to the responses she received. These were secure attachment, avoidant insecure attachment, and ambivalent insecure attachment. There was also a fourth pattern named disorganised insecure attachment, which was later established by researchers.</p>

<p>Since then, a number of researchers have backed up Ainsworth's attachment theories, indicating that attachment types have an impact on later behaviours.</p>

<p>Researchers studied youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18 months as they reacted to being left alone for a short time before being returned to their mothers.</p>

<p>The unusual scenario has also been challenged for its ethical implications. The study breached the ethical rule protecting participants by putting the youngster under strain (separation and stranger fear). However, in its defence, if a youngster grew excessively agitated, the separation events were cut short. According to Marrone (1998), despite the fact that the Strange Situation has been criticised for being unpleasant, it is imitating everyday situations, since mothers do leave their new-borns for short periods of time in various settings, frequently with strangers such as babysitters.</p>

<p>Finally, the report's sample is skewed, consisting of 100 American middle-class households. As a result, extrapolating the results outside of America and to working-class households is problematic.</p>

<h2>HARRY HARLOW</h2>

<p>Harry Harlow was among the first psychologists to methodically investigate the nature of human love and connection. Harry Harlow showed through his research, which was disputed by many scholars, that love and the bonds between people have a tremendous effect on the trajectory of their development and whether it will be healthy or not.</p>

<p>In the early part of the twentieth century, many psychologists believed that offering compassion to children was only an emotional gesture that had no actual value.</p>

<p>There was a prevalent view among the psychologists of the early twentieth century that it did not matter if one showed affection towards children because it only served as a sentimental gesture and nothing more. Many intellectuals of the time believed that affection would simply spread infections and cause adult psychological issues.</p>

<p>Psychologists were driven by a desire to establish psychology as a scientific discipline. During this time, the behaviourist movement dominated the discipline of psychology. Only observable and measurable actions should be studied according to this method.</p>

<p>However, a scholar named Harry Harlow from the United States became interested in studying a subject that was impossible to define and measure: love. In a series of disputed experiments conducted in the 1960s, Harlow revealed the huge impacts of love, especially the lack of love.</p>

<p>His research showed how deprivation had a disastrous effect on new-born rhesus monkeys. Harlow's study highlighted the significance of a caregiver's affection in a child's healthy development.</p>

<p>Many prior theories of love assumed that a newborn's first attachment to his or her mother was just a way for the child to obtain food, quench their thirst, and avoid suffering. Harlow, on the other hand, thought that this behavioural explanation for mother-child bonding was insufficient.</p>
