            <h2>Lesson 1: The Stages of Attachment Outlined by Bowlby </h2>

            <p>In psychology, attachment theory originated from the work of John Bowlby. During the 1930s, Bowlby worked in a Child Guidance Clinic in London as a psychiatrist. There, he treated hundreds of psychologically disturbed children dealing with various mental health, abuse, and emotional situations.</p>
<p>At that time, Bowlby began to consider the importance of the relationship between a mother and child. He looked at various aspects, including cognitive, social, and emotional development. This shaped his beliefs about early infant separation and how being away from their mother would lead the child to maladjustment later in life. All of this played a role in the starting point of Bowlby's attachment theory.</p>
<p>Bowlby's definition of attachment is the "lasting psychological connectedness between human beings." He proposed that his attachment theory could be understood using the context in that the caregiver provides the infant with safety and security. And attachment is adaptable because it promotes the child's chances for success and survival.</p>

<h2>About John Bowlby</h2>
<p>Edward John Mostyn Bowlby was born on February 26, 1907 and died on September 2, 1990. He was known as the originator of the attachment theory. He explored the behavioural and psychological consequences of strong and weak individuals and how that connects with their relationship with their mothers.</p>
<p>Bowlby was raised by an upper-middle-class family in London. His father was a surgeon, and he didn't spend much time with him whilst growing up. He also didn't spend much time with his mother, which was the custom at that time for children of his class. Instead, Bowlby was raised primarily by a nanny and other nursemaids.</p>
<p>After being sent to boarding school in 1918, Bowlby trained to be a naval officer. Eventually, he chose to study medicine in Cambridge at Trinity College. After two years, his focus switched to psychology. After graduating in 1928, he volunteered as a teacher at two schools for children with behavioural issues. He later joined the Tavistock Institute in London, where he created a research unit that focused on examining how children were affected after being separated from their primary caregivers.</p>
<p>Bowlby's career truly took off when he shared his ideas on the mental health of homeless children in a 1951 report at the invitation of the World Health Organisation. This report was translated into 14 languages and focused on the importance of consistent love and care by a mother figure for a young child's development. He laid out his fully developed attachment theory in his work Attachment and Loss, three volumes released between 1969 and 1980.</p>

<h2>Pre-Attachment</h2>
<p>The pre-attachment period occurs at the very beginning and takes place between birth and three months of age. During this time, the infant does not develop any attachment to a specific caregiver. However, they will prefer listening to human voices or looking at faces. During their initial two to three months, babies respond to other humans, but they will not distinguish between them.</p>
<p>At around six weeks, the appearance of a human face will trigger social responses such as a smile or eye contact from the baby. Although the baby will often smile at any face that appears to them, Bowlby has suggested that their social skills, such as smiling, will help increase the chances of the caretaker responding to the child in a kind and loving manner. In addition, this action helps to promote attachment.</p>
<p>The infant will also encourage attachment with their caregiver using behaviours such as crying, grasping, or babbling. Each new behaviour brings the baby in close contact with their caregiver and thus promotes an emotional bonding experience.</p>

<h2>Attachment in Making</h2>
<p>When babies are between six weeks and eight months of age, they will begin to distinguish between people and reserve their attachment behaviour for those they prefer to be with. They start to develop trust and will expect responses from their primary caregivers. Babies at this stage will also calm down faster when they receive care from their primary caregiver as opposed to receiving care from strangers. Still, that doesn't mean they will reject or dislike the stranger.</p>
<p>Babies at this stage often will smile and coo at their primary caregiver but only stare at strangers. If they are crying or upset, their favourite caregiver will be able to comfort them faster than a stranger would. An infant's preferences will be restricted to just two or three people, and they will typically prefer one individual over another. According to Bowlby and other attachment theory researchers, the person they prefer most is often the child's mother. However, it could be anyone who has responded to the child's needs and had more positive interactions with them.</p>
<p>When a baby reaches one year of age, they have created a model of their favourite person in their minds, including how they look and how well they respond to them.</p>

<h2>Reciprocal Relationships</h2>
<p>From the age of 18 months until the child becomes an adult, the attachment starts to waver, and the child's separation anxiety begins to decrease. This occurs because the child begins to understand circumstances; for example, when their favourite person leaves, it doesn't mean they are gone forever, and they will return. Aside from that, Bowlby didn't have much to say about the fourth phase of the attachment theory or how specific attachments continued to impact people after they had reached adulthood.</p>
<p>Bowlby did, however, observe that at around three years of age, children will begin to comprehend that their caregivers have plans or goals of their own. As a result, the child becomes less concerned over time whenever their caretaker goes away to work or run errands without them. As a result of this, the child is no longer as concerned when their favourite person leaves for a short time.</p>

<h2>Rudolph Schaffer and Peggy Emerson's Observations</h2>
<p>This section will look at attachment theory from a different perspective using Schaffer and Emerson's observations. In 1964, Schaffer and Emerson observed 60 babies at monthly intervals for their first 18 months using a longitudinal method.</p>
<p>The infants were observed in their own homes and were visited each month for approximately a year. In addition, the experts analysed interactions with their caregivers and established if or when the children started to show signs of separation anxiety.</p>
<p>The studies showed that attachment was most likely to form between the infant and those who were most sensitive to the baby's signals. However, that did not necessarily mean the child spent the most time with the same person.</p>
<p>By the age of 10 months, the children showed signs of several attachments, including close attachments to their mothers, fathers, and siblings.</p>
<p>The mother was the favourite for around half of the babies at the age of 18 months, and the father was the favourite for the other half.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest that being responsive and sensitive to an infant and doing things such as playing with them or communicating with them is more instrumental in developing attachment than actual physical care.</p>

<h2>About Schaffer and Emerson</h2>
<p>Rudolph Schaffer and Peggy Emerson are researchers who developed the Stages of Attachment in 1964. Whilst they may not be as well-known as Bowlby, they did some ground-breaking work to support the attachment theory and came up with their own additions to the theory.</p>
<p>Schaffer was born into a Jewish family in 1926, in Berlin, during the rise of Nazism. Sadly, both of his parents were unfortunate victims of the tragic events of that time. He attended the University of Liverpool, where he initially studied architecture but left the institution before completion. He then moved to London, where he studied psychology at Birkbeck College. Between the years of 1951 and 1955, Schaffer worked under the direction of John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic.</p>
<p>He took a position as a clinical psychologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow and worked there until 1964. Afterwards, he went on to earn his PhD from the University of Glasgow. Schaffer became one of the most influential developmental psychologists in all of Britain. Reflecting on his own traumatic childhood, he was able to transform those horrific memories into something worthwhile, as it drove him toward wanting to learn more about early childhood socialism, attachment, and healthy interactions between a mother and her new-born baby.</p>
<p>Although there are many similarities between the observations made by Schaffer and Emerson and Bowlby, the pair disagree with Bowlby's theory of attachment in some ways. The main difference is that Schaffer and Emerson believed a child could have multiple attachments, and those attachments didn't only include the child's mother.</p>

<h2>The Four Stages of Attachment (Schaffer and Emerson)</h2>

<h3>Pre-Attachment Stage</h3>
<p>The pre-attachment stage, also known as the asocial stage, lasts from birth to around three months. During this time, there is no attachment to a specific caregiver. The child has a similar response to both objects and people; however, they tend to prefer faces and eyes.</p>

<h3>Indiscriminate Attachment</h3>
<p>The indiscriminate attachment stage lasts between six weeks and seven months of age. During this time, the child prefers their primary or secondary caregivers. This is also when they start to develop trust with others, and most can distinguish between familiar people and those who are unfamiliar. They begin to build a stronger attachment with individuals they are familiar with. Currently, they do not show an aversion to strangers.</p>

<h3>Discriminate Attachment</h3>
<p>The discriminate attachment stage lasts between seven and eleven months of age. It is also known as the specific attachment period. During this time, the child will develop a strong attachment to a particular individual. In addition, they will start to experience separation anxiety when they are away from that person and will begin to have an aversion to anyone they are unfamiliar with. This is the beginning of the social referencing stage.</p>

<h3>Multiple Attachments</h3>
<p>The multiple attachment stage lasts from nine months forward. During this time, the child will show signs of a strong emotional bond with other caregivers instead of just one person. This is when babies start to show a growing interest in their friends, grandparents, and other familiar individuals.</p>
