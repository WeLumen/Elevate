            <h2>Lesson 2: Bowlby's Theory of Attachment </h2>
<p>In the 1930s, psychologist John Bowlby discovered that (whilst working with them) maladjusted and delinquent youngsters had difficulty building intimate relationships with others. He investigated the children's family histories and learnt that many of them had suffered family strife when they were young.</p>

<p>Bowlby came to the opinion that a parent's early emotional bond with their child is critical to their child's healthy development. As a result, challenges to that link may have long-term effects on a child. Bowlby drew on a range of viewpoints to form his opinions, including psychodynamics, behavioural and cognitive psychology, and ethology.</p>

<p>Attachment theory was born as a result of his efforts. Babies were thought to become bonded to their caregivers since they fed them at the time.</p>

<h2>Four Phases of Attachment</h2>
<p>Attachment was viewed as a taught trait in this behaviourist approach. Bowlby had a different point of view. He believes that human growth should be viewed through the lens of evolution. Infants have survived for most of human history by remaining in close proximity to adult carers.</p>

<p>Attachment behaviours in children evolved to ensure that the youngster could remain safe under the protection of their caregivers. As a result, the gestures, sounds, and other signals that new-borns use to obtain adults' attention and maintain contact are adaptive.</p>

<p>There are four phases during which children develop an attachment with their primary caregiver, according to Bowlby; these are explored next.</p>

<h2>Birth to Three Months</h2>
<p>Infants love to gaze at and listen to human faces and voices from the moment they are born. Infants respond to people during their first two to three months of existence, but they can't tell them apart. Babies will cheerfully smile and make eye contact when they see human faces at the age of six weeks. Whilst the baby will grin at every face that comes into their range of vision, Bowlby believes that social smiling enhances the likelihood of the caretaker responding with loving attention, establishing a connection.</p>

<p>Crying, grabbing, and sucking are also ways for the baby to encourage bonding with his or her carers. Each of these behaviours brings the infant closer to the caregiver, promoting bonding and emotional engagement.</p>

<h2>Three to Six Months</h2>
<p>Around the age of three months, new-borns begin to distinguish between people and reserve their attachment behaviours for those they prefer. They'll grin and talk to individuals they know, but they won't do anything but look at strangers.</p>

<p>Their favourite people are those better equipped to console them if they weep. Babies' choices are limited to two to three people, and they normally favour one of them over the others. Early on, Bowlby, along with many other psychologists, believed that this person would be the mother of the baby, but it later became clear to them that it could be anyone that showed affection and also interacted with the baby in the best way possible.</p>

<p>When babies are around six months old, they develop a strong attachment to a single person, and they experience separation anxiety when that person leaves the room. When babies learn to crawl, they will try to actively follow that person.</p>

<p>When this person returns home after a long absence, the babies will ecstatically greet them. Babies begin to dread strangers at the age of seven or eight months. This can range from greater caution in the presence of strangers to outright tears at the sight of someone new, especially in an unusual scenario. By the age of one year, babies have established a functioning model of their preferred individual, which includes how effectively they respond to the youngster.</p>

<h2>Six Months to Three Years</h2>
<p>Bowlby didn't specify much about the fourth stage of attachment or how attachments impacted people after they were children. He did see, however, that at about the age of three, youngsters begin to understand that their caregivers have their own aims and ambitions. As a result, when the caretaker goes away for some time, the youngster is less anxious.</p>

<h2>Strange Situation Study</h2>
<p>Mary Ainsworth became John Bowlby's research assistant and long-term colleague after relocating to England in the 1950s. Whilst Bowlby had noticed that children had unique attachment characteristics, it was Ainsworth's study on infant-parent separations that helped to build a clearer understanding of these distinctions.</p>

<p>The 'Strange Situation' approach was created by Ainsworth and her colleagues to measure these differences in one-year-old toddlers. It is considered widely in the psychological world to be an essential study within the field.</p>

<p>The Strange Situation is made up of two short scenarios in which a caretaker abandons a newborn in a lab. The infant is left with a stranger in the first scenario. In the second scenario, the child is left alone for a short time before being joined by the stranger. Each time the caregiver and the child were separated, it lasted around three minutes.</p>

<p>As a result of Ainsworth and her colleagues' investigations of the Strange Situation, they were able to uncover three distinct attachment patterns. Based on the results of additional study, a fourth attachment style was developed afterwards.</p>

<h2>Four Attachment Patterns</h2>
<p>Securely connected infants use their caregiver as a safe haven from which to explore the world. They will go out to explore away from the caregiver, but will return if they are afraid or need comfort. They, like other new-borns, will be distressed if the caregiver disappears. These youngsters, on the other hand, feel convinced that their caregiver will return. When this happens, the child will be overjoyed to see the caregiver.</p>

<h2>Secure Attachment</h2>
<p>Children with avoidant attachment have a shaky relationship with their caregiver. When their caregiver goes, avoidantly attached youngsters will not be sad, and when the caregiver returns, the child will purposefully avoid the caregiver.</p>

<h2>Avoidant Attachment</h2>
<p>Another type of insecure attachment is resistant attachment. When a parent departs, the children become terribly distressed. When the caregiver returns, though, their behaviour will be unpredictable.</p>

<h2>Resistant Connection</h2>
<p>They may appear delighted to meet the caretaker at first, then grow hostile when the caregiver tries to pick them up. These children frequently react aggressively to their caregivers, but they also show signs of avoidance.</p>

<h2>Disorganised Attachment</h2>
<p>Children who have been subjected to violence, deprivation, or other irregular parenting techniques are more likely to exhibit the ultimate attachment pattern.</p>

<p>When their caretaker is around, children with a disordered attachment style appear bewildered or confused. They appear to consider the caregiver as both a source of comfort and a source of terror, resulting in disordered and contradictory behaviour. This can lead to a lot of psychological problems for the child down the line.</p>

<p>Early attachment types, according to research, have long-term effects on a person's life. Someone who had a stable attachment style as a child, for example, will have higher self-esteem as an adult and be able to create strong, healthy relationships. Those who acquired an untrusting attachment style as children may find it challenging to become emotionally connected in their interactions and to express their feelings and ideas with others.</p>

<p>Those who had a resistive attachment type as a one-year-old have a hard time building relationships as adults, and when they do, they often wonder if their partners actually love them. This can stay with them throughout their lives if not treated.</p>
