            <h2>Lesson 2: Other Factors of Ambivalent Attachment</h2>

            <h3>DIFFERENT THEORIES OF AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT</h3>

<p>As mentioned previously, this attachment style has been approached differently by varying researchers in the field of attachment theory, which has led to many different labels and sub-classifications. The different words used by specific theorists can make studying attachment theory a bit confusing, especially when it comes to ambivalent, anxious-preoccupied, anxious, or preoccupied attachment theories. These all describe relatively similar insecure attachment patterns, but we will discuss some important distinctions in this section.</p>

<h2>DIFFERENT LABELS, SIMILAR TRAITS</h2>
<p>Bowlby called it ambivalent, but Ainsworth labelled this attachment style 'resistant' at first—which came to be recognised as a misnomer as more research was completed. Since then, there have been many different labels used, and perhaps only psychologists would definitely be able to discern the minute differences between these slight variations. However, for our purposes, it is more important just to know that this variety of names exists so you can recognise them when referring to or reading about attachment theory from different sources. Much of the foundational theory and characteristics of these attachment types are similar enough that they are interchangeable for layperson's purposes.</p>

<h2>PASSIVE AND RESISTANT-AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT</h2>
<p>Ainsworth also identified two distinct sub-classifications within ambivalent attachment, defined as ambivalent-resistant and ambivalent-passive.</p>
<p>Ambivalent-resistant children were marked by demonstrative anger and frustration with their caregivers upon their return: seeking attention and then aggressively rejecting it even if they aren't verbally or physically acting aggressively. On the other hand, the ambivalent-passive children tended to cling to their caregivers but displayed anxiety and an unwillingness to explore or interact with strangers.</p>

<h2>MENTAL HEALTH AND AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT STYLE</h2>
<p>Now that we have discussed how ambivalence attachment styles form, as well as the characteristics and different terms used to describe this general attachment behaviour, let's learn how this attachment style impacts mental health.</p>

<h2>TRAUMA RESPONSES IN AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT</h2>
<p>As we discussed in the last module, trauma is a person's response to a distressing event or circumstance which overwhelms their ability to cope and maintain normal functioning. Attachment wounds can manifest as trauma for some people, and many people with an ambivalent attachment style have survived traumatic situations of various kinds.</p>
<p>Through this trauma-informed perspective, we see that much of the ambivalently attached individual's characteristic actions may be driven by what psychologists call the 'fight' response. It is one of the four main recognised trauma responses and does not necessarily refer to physical aggression or fighting. Rather, this is the gut feeling to confront whatever is causing distress directly to protect oneself, often at any cost.</p>
<p>Children may feign emotions or do whatever they think might get the attention and care they desire.</p>

<h2>DISORDERS RELATED TO AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT</h2>
<p>In addition to the likelihood of having an automatic trauma response to certain situations, an ambivalent attachment style has been linked to a higher likelihood of certain other mood and personality disorders developing.</p>
<p>The emotional dysregulation and constantly high emotions can contribute to depression or any number of anxiety disorders, especially because people with ambivalent attachment styles tend to struggle with bouncing back from stressful periods. Their intense fear of rejection is thought to be possibly tied to histrionic disorders, avoidance disorders, dependency disorders, and sometimes borderline personality disorder. There is also a significant overlap between ambivalent disorder and oppositional defiance disorder, which would make sense due to their default trauma response being that of fight.</p>
<p>Finally, many of the behaviours of ambivalent attachment share similarities with the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactive disorder, or ADHD. So far, researchers have not postulated that ambivalent attachment causes or is linked to this disorder—but some children have been misdiagnosed with ADHD when they actually had significant unresolved ambivalent attachment trauma.</p>

<h2>AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT IN ADULT RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>Now that we have reviewed the mental health implications of an ambivalent attachment style, let's discuss how it impacts adult relationships. We will focus on romantic and sexual relationships in this section.</p>
<p>Adults with this attachment style approach relationships with a somewhat contradictory perspective: they crave intimacy and dependable romantic relationships, but they also anticipate rejection and require a lot of reassurance to believe the relationship is mutually desired and enjoyable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their low self-esteem can cause them to behave in ways that are clingy and smothering, which may wind up ultimately pushing the partner, who they wanted to be closer to, further away.</p>
<p>They can also push their partners away in more direct ways, becoming anxious and jealous and then angry with their partner—even if their anxiety is not based on reality. There is often a cycle of outbursts followed by pleading for forgiveness and taking apparent accountability, only for the jealousy and insecurity to repeat themselves again shortly after.</p>

<p>We have now completed Module 6, covering ambivalent attachment style. You should now understand what causes this attachment style, as well as understand some of the different labels and sub-classifications and the traits common among those with ambivalent attachment. We also reviewed some of the mental health and relationship impacts that this attachment style may cause.</p>
