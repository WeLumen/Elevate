            <h2>Lesson 1: What Does Secure Attachment Look Like? </h2>
            <p>To begin this module, we will dive right into discussing the characteristics of secure attachment in individuals over the lifespan of a typical human. This will include descriptions of secure attachment in infants, children, and adults. Some of the statistical outcomes and population observations related to secure attachment research will also be reviewed. Let's begin by discussing secure attachment characteristics in infanthood.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURE ATTACHMENT IN INFANTS</h2>

<p>As discussed in previous modules, attachment begins to develop during the first eight months of a person's life. Trying to decipher the type of attachment an infant has during this phase-which Bowlby defined as the 'Attachment in Making' phase-can be difficult and counterproductive since babies are still developing the capacity to form attachments and may have more erratic attachment behaviour as a result.</p>

<p>Whilst babies of this age may display indicators of secure attachment, such as distress being relieved in the presence of their primary caregiver, their pattern may fluctuate quite a bit during the early stages of life. However, this variance should not necessarily be considered a predictor of attachment style throughout the rest of childhood.</p>

<p>That said, once infants reach around eight months of age, they begin the 'Clear-Cut' attachment phase, and their patterns of attachment begin to solidify. A baby on its way to developing a secure attachment style in this phase will frequently cry it's left by its primary caregiver and calm down relatively quickly once the caregiver returns, playing and exploring freely in their presence. One obvious indicator that secure attachment is forming is an infant's reaction of comfort and calm when their primary caregiver is physically interacting with them. Whilst they may be able to be soothed by others, it is typically pretty clear that they prefer contact with their primary caregiver.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURE ATTACHMENT IN CHILDREN</h2>

<p>Once babies begin to blossom into walking, talking children, the behaviours associated with secure attachments start to become more distinct.</p>

<p>These children can tolerate being separated from their caregivers but display more positive behaviours and visible happiness when their caregiver returns. Additionally, these children will seek comfort and reassurance from their parents when they are anxious or frightened.</p>

<p>We are all likely familiar with another characteristic of secure attachment in children, which is illustrated in behaviours like hiding their faces or refusing to talk to people they don't know. These behaviours indicate the presence of anxiety or shyness around strangers. This is a normal part of development and indicative of a preference for their caregivers and the safety that they provide.</p>

<p>During later stages of childhood, securely attached individuals tend to be more empathetic and considerate, and they are commonly referred to as 'mature' within psychological reports and studies. Additionally, some studies have indicated that securely attached children are far less disruptive or aggressive than their insecurely attached peers.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURE ATTACHMENT IN ADULTS</h2>

<p>Attachment theory was originally developed to understand how early childhood experiences impact our behaviour as adults, so there has been a lot of research and theorising surrounding the characteristics of mature humans with different attachment styles. Secure attachment, by its nature of being the least disruptive attachment style to relationships and well-being, has had somewhat less attention, but we can still identify and discuss some discrete characteristics of securely attached adults.</p>

<p>These people usually have a relatively easy time with social bonding, intimacy and long-term relationships because they are emotionally aware and expressive whilst maintaining internal balance. Perhaps the most defining characteristic is that they have a positive self-view or high self-esteem. They believe in their value and place in the world and do not need a ton of validation or reassurance to maintain their connection to that belief. This lack of need for validation does not result in social avoidance; instead, it enables a securely attached adult to enjoy their alone time equally with time spent in the presence of others.</p>

<p>In addition to a positive view of themselves, people with secure attachment styles also tend to have a generally positive view of the people in their life. Whilst this may look different for everyone-it's most apparent in intimate or romantic relationships. A securely attached individual will often assume the best intentions and be disinclined to jealousy or doubt. Once again, they are unlikely to require excessive reassurance from their partners to feel loved. As a result, their general demeanour in relationships and social situations is typically described as warm, easy-going, loving, and lovable. Long-term relationships are important to these individuals.</p>

<p>Securely attached adults are able to regulate their emotions independently and communicate their needs effectively in social interactions and, therefore, bond easily with others. Mutual dependency, as well as independently goal-oriented behaviour, strike a healthy balance in their lives. They also tend to have a profound capacity for self-reflection and emotional problem-solving.</p>

<p>The last characteristic of adults with secure attachment styles, which we will discuss, is a positive view of their own childhood experiences. No childhood is a fairy-tale of perfection, but these individuals are able to make sense of their early experiences without severe distress or confusion.</p>

<h2>STATISTICS AND OUTCOMES</h2>

<p>It is estimated that between 55 and 66 per cent of westernised countries' populations have secure attachment styles-depending on what research one is referencing. It is also worth noting that one study on intergenerational attachment styles found that 70 per cent of infants born would wind up having the same attachment style as their mother at the time of birth.</p>

<p>Passing on the gift of a secure attachment style is certainly a desirable outcome for most parents, and we will discuss how adults can learn to be more securely attached in a later section of this module.</p>
