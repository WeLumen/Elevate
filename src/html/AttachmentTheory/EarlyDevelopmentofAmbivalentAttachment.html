            <h2>Lesson 1: Early Development of Ambivalent 
                Attachment</h2>
                
<p>As explained in previous modules, attachment style usually begins to solidify around six months of age. This module will examine the circumstances and caregiver behaviours that can lead to infants and young children developing an ambivalent attachment style.</p>

<p>Ambivalent attachment style is also known as anxious, preoccupied or anxious-ambivalent attachment, depending on which theorist or study is being referenced. We will begin by identifying the different factors that can lead to children developing this attachment style, including caregiver behaviours and environmental factors, which may be beyond the caregiver's discrete control.</p>

<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that this section of attachment theory has significant variance between the different varieties of attachment theory and the different theorists. We will describe some of the subclassifications and differences between what is considered ambivalent, anxious-preoccupied, and other labels used to describe similar presentations of attachment behaviour.</p>

<p>For these sections (which describe conditions that lead to and the characteristics of this attachment style), you will learn mostly about the overlap in the various attachment theories, and ambivalent or anxious-preoccupied attachment styles will be used interchangeably to describe the broader diagnostic category.</p>

<h2>CAREGIVER BEHAVIOURS</h2>

<p>Inconsistency is the defining dynamic of the relationship with their caregiver for infants who may be developing ambivalent attachment styles. The caretaker will sometimes be quite responsive and emotionally available for their child's needs but at other times demonstrate a lack of attention to those needs. This inconsistency creates a situation where the child cannot rely on a predictable pattern of behaviour from the people who are responsible for their safety. It can also begin to create palpable confusion for the young child regarding the status of their relationship with this person.</p>

<p>Another caregiver behaviour that has been linked to anxious-preoccupied attachment style is a pattern that psychologists have labelled 'emotional hunger.' This is when a caregiver has excessive emotional hunger and turns to their children to get their own emotional needs met, whether that is love, approval, or social acceptance. This role reversal can be deeply unsettling and confusing for children of any age. Caregivers might also go to great lengths and even coordinate with children to present themselves as 'the perfect parent' or be overly controlling or fussy about the child.</p>

<p>Finally, an ambivalent attachment style can develop due to abusive experiences during early childhood. Certainly, not all children who are abused develop this attachment style, nor does the attachment style necessitate abuse to develop. However, it can be a contributing factor.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</h2>

<p>If a caregiver has some sort of emergency or vocational situation where the baby is left alone or without a surrogate primary caregiver (that they accept) for long periods of time, the prolonged separation can be a factor in that infant developing an ambivalent attachment style. Children who are permanently separated from a mother or other primary caregiver at a young age may also be at elevated risk of developing this attachment pattern.</p>

<p>Insecure attachment styles are frequently multigenerational, not because of any known genetic link but rather because up to 70 per cent of young children develop the same attachment style that their mother had when they were born.</p>

<p>This is thought to be because people frequently normalise the conditions that they grew up in and either consciously or subconsciously seek to repeat the patterns of parenting that were used to raise them. Whilst this emotional inheritance does not absolve anyone of harmful behaviours, it can be helpful to understand the context of the past and that quite a lot of attachment wounding is not intentional—more automatic and instinctive. It takes quite a bit of fortitude and focus to break that pattern.</p>

<p>The factors explained in this section are just some of the behaviours and events that researchers have found are common amongst those with ambivalent or anxious-preoccupied attachment. Often, therapeutic interventions for the caregiver may be able to resolve and heal the insecure attachment with their child, so it is important to think about these dynamics holistically and compassionately.</p>

<h2>PRESENTATION OF AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT</h2>

<p>Now that you are aware of the situations that can lead to the development of ambivalent attachment style let's learn about the traits that psychologists and other professionals have observed in people with this attachment style. We will review the characteristics of infants, children and adults.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT IN INFANTS</h2>

<p>In Ainsworth's Strange Situation experiment, babies with anxious-ambivalent attachment styles were observed to explore very little and to be wary or even fearful of strangers, even in the presence of their caregivers. When caregivers were separated from these infants, the babies showed high degrees of distress: wailing, crying or screaming. However, when the caregiver returns after an episode, the child would be ambivalent about their presence instead of displaying the positive behaviours that would be seen in secure attachment. They would appear confused, avoid direct eye contact, and perhaps even seem agitated or stunned by the return of the caregiver.</p>

<p>In the real world, this might look like a baby who seems to fluctuate between disinterest and distress, and they may be less curious about toys or games, such as peek-a-boo than is typical. They may appear 'fussy' or clingy to the untrained eye. They may seem desperate for attention and care even when their immediate needs have been sated.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT IN CHILDREN</h2>

<p>Ambivalent attachment develops into more distinct behaviours as infants become toddlers and eventually children. These children will be intensely focused on remaining in close proximity to their caregiver, but similar to the behaviour of ambivalent infants, they derive little comfort from their attention or presence. This focus on remaining close can lead to what psychologists call 'up-regulating' behaviours.</p>

<p>These behaviours include expressions of anger, distress, or even temper tantrums when they are left without their caregiver. The attempts to up-regulate may not stop when the carer returns, either, since the child will usually not feel soothed by their return. Instead, they may even direct their anger and distress at the caregiver, lashing out and sometimes developing resentment at quite a young age.</p>

<p>These children may also appear needy and desperate for attention and care from caregivers or authority figures, such as their teachers, as they get older. They can act out or become the teacher's pet. They might also be over-reactive and appear to have a lot of excess energy.</p>

<p>These children are also likely to feel apprehensive about exploring the world or experiencing new things, wishing to have the direct support of the caregiver or other authority figure if they must do such things. They may not like going on outings or play dates with other children unless their caregiver is present and may struggle with regulating their emotions as they get older.</p>

<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF AMBIVALENT ATTACHMENT IN ADULTS</h2>

<p>Adults with ambivalent attachment tend to be extremely self-critical with low self-esteem. They may require a lot of reassurance and seek external validation often, but even when they get these emotional needs met, their self-esteem and emotional regulation problems remain. These individuals continue to expect and anticipate rejection, especially in more intimate or close relationships. So, even though they deeply crave intimacy and social interconnectivity, they are often so anxious about connecting that they come off as flighty or unreliable.</p>

<p>The seven to 15 per cent of estimated adults with this attachment style may also have difficulty with sustaining relationships, which we will discuss more in the last section of this module. Their anxiety and preoccupation with what 'could be' often keeps them from experiencing and enjoying what is happening currently.</p>
