            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your course Attachment Theory. This course is divided into 10 modules.</p>

            <h2>Module 1</h2>
            <p>We will begin the course by looking into the details of Attachment Theory. We will explore some of the key figures in the field, such as John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth, and Harry Harlow. The module includes an in-depth look at Bowlby's Theory of Attachment and the Strange Situation Study. We will also examine Harry Harlow's Maternal Deprivation Study.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 2</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on comparing two major attachment theories. The first part discusses Bowlby’s research-based theory, while the second part reviews the study conducted by Schaffer and Emerson, noting the similarities and differences between the two approaches.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 3</h2>
            <p>We continue our exploration by examining the stages of attachment. This module introduces Erik Erikson’s work, which was influenced by Freud’s personality theories. We will also discuss cultural influences on attachment and broader aspects of social development. Finally, we will cover the eight stages of attachment in full detail.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 4</h2>
            <p>This module explores the characteristics of securely attached individuals during infancy, childhood, and adulthood. We will look at outcomes and statistics related to secure attachment, as well as the emotional conditions necessary for its development, with a special focus on trust. We will also discuss how adults with insecure attachment styles can move toward secure attachment intentionally.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 5</h2>
            <p>Here, we will examine the development of avoidant attachment style in infancy, including caregiver behaviours and environmental factors. We will describe key traits of this style across different life stages and explore the connection between the flight response and avoidance. Additionally, we will look at mental health issues and relationship challenges associated with avoidant attachment, supported by relevant psychological research and data.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 6</h2>
            <p>Module 6 delves into the factors that contribute to the ambivalent attachment style in childhood. We will identify the behaviours and emotional patterns common to this attachment style in infants, children, and adults. The two subtypes—resistant and passive—will also be described. We will explore the ‘fight’ trauma response and mental health impacts, along with this attachment style’s influence on adult relationships. Important research findings and statistics will be presented.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 7</h2>
            <p>In this module, we examine the origins of disorganised attachment in early childhood. We will discuss both the external circumstances and caregiver behaviours that contribute to this attachment style. The module includes descriptions of disorganised behaviours in different age groups and explains the freeze response, alongside associated mental health implications and adult relationship dynamics. Research-based insights and data will be shared throughout.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 8</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on how attachment style influences emotional coaching in children. We will explore emotion regulation techniques, the importance of modelling empathy and trust, and how to support children with insecure attachments. The role of teachers, healthcare providers, and other significant adults will be considered. Lastly, we will reflect on the fluidity of attachment styles and the value of using them as tools for understanding, rather than as fixed labels.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 9</h2>
            <p>Here, we take a closer look at adult attachment styles. We begin with traits of securely attached adults—emotional safety, fulfilling relationships, and life satisfaction. We then explore the avoidant style, characterized by emotional withdrawal and extreme independence, followed by the ambivalent style, marked by dependency and relationship insecurity. Finally, we examine the disorganised attachment style, which often includes emotional volatility and contradictory behaviours around closeness. The psychological and relational impacts of each style will be reviewed.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 10</h2>
            <p>In the final module, we will explore some of the major critiques of attachment theory. These include J.R. Harris’s challenge to the ‘nurture assumption,’ the limitations of stress-based behavioural studies, and the early theory's overemphasis on the mother-child relationship. We will also consider cultural biases in attachment theory and its Western-centric perspective. Despite these critiques, we will reflect on how attachment theory remains useful for educators, conflict mediators, and mental health professionals, offering insight into human connection and development.</p>
