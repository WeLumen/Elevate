            <h2>Lesson 1: Early Development of Disorganised Attachment</h2>
                <h3>Caregiver Behaviours</h3>
<p>As we have learnt throughout this course, attachment styles begin to form during infancy. This section will describe the potential factors that psychologists think could account for the development of disorganised attachment style during the first years of life.</p>

<p>Whilst the other two insecure attachment styles that we have discussed (ambivalent and avoidant) typically do not arise due to straightforward neglect or abuse, children with disorganised attachment styles are much more likely to have experienced some form of abuse, neglect or significant trauma during early childhood.</p>

<p>The abuse can range from emotional to sexual to other forms of violence. There are certainly still environmental factors that can be traumatic or abusive beyond the actions or discrete choices of the caregivers, but much attention has been given to the behaviours of parents and caretakers that can lead to the development of this attachment style.</p>

<p>Disorganised attachment arises when a child's primary source of safety and comfort, which is supposed to be their caregiver, becomes a source of fear. Babies are born with the subconscious knowledge that their survival is dependent on the care of their parents or other caregivers, and when that knowledge does not match their reality, dissonance and confusion begin to manifest.</p>

<p>This situation can, unfortunately, arise when a caregiver is going through their own turbulent emotions or life circumstances and is not able to respond in consistent ways to their infant. Their own depression or trauma may be impacting their emotional regulation. Caregivers who have volatile mood swings or very big emotions can cause children to wonder what reaction they will get next, creating a growing atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. The child is stuck between the need for safety and care and their caregiver's inability to provide that with any consistency, and thus, the child begins to actively fear the caregiver as a result. They may also not feel assured that their needs will be met or even addressed by this person who is causing them so much distress.</p>

<p>Additionally, some caregivers may behave in outright hostile and selfish ways towards their child - becoming enraged when they have basic needs or venting their emotions towards the infant. Some mental health issues can lead mothers to resent or feel disgust towards their baby, as well, which can lead to hot and cold behaviour that could result in a disorganised attachment style.</p>

<p>To summarise, the overall pattern of behaviour for caregivers of children who are developing a disorganised attachment style in infanthood is one marked by emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, unpredictability, and lashing out.</p>

<h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
<p>There are several different circumstances that could contribute to a young child developing a disorganised attachment style absent of the impact of their caretaker's direct behaviours. For example, relationships that a caregiver is involved in and bringing their baby around may also significantly impact attachment style - and witnessing the caregiver being abused in these relationships has been shown to contribute to some disorganised attachment traits. Whilst this is still somewhat the responsibility of the caretaker, relationships can shift rapidly and be difficult to leave in certain circumstances. Other family members can also be difficult to disengage from if the caretaker holds values that prioritise family bonds.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is the possibility of some sort of trauma happening to the child, which is entirely out of the caregiver's control, such as a car accident or witnessing a family member be gravely injured. These events can be safeguarded only to a certain extent, and a young child's mind struggles to process and respond to trauma significant during the early stages of infancy. Young children can also develop disorganised attachment styles due to witnessing their caregiver experience trauma or even from being in their care whilst they are dealing with the after-effects of said trauma.</p>

<p>Research has also shown that certain neurological issues and medications can lead to or exacerbate disorganised attachment behaviours. Long periods of separation can also increase the likelihood of this attachment style forming.</p>

<p>Again, no childhood is totally perfect, and occasional emotionally ineffective behaviours or circumstances do not lead to a disorganised attachment style. Described in this section are just a few of the components that are thought to lead to the development of disorganised attachment styles. Even though this is the attachment style most often correlated with abuse - up to 80 per cent of children with a disorganised attachment style have experienced abuse from their caregivers - it is important for caregivers or mental health providers to identify and address any external barriers that could be contributing the lack of stability in the caregiver's responses.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Disorganised Attachment</h2>
<p>Now that you are aware of the factors that can lead children to develop a disorganised attachment style, let's talk about the characteristics which have been observed in individuals with this attachment style. We will review the identifying traits for infants, children and adults.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Disorganised Attachment in Infants</h2>
<p>In Ainsworth's Strange Situation experiment, she noticed that there was a small group of infants whose behaviour was inconsistent with any of the currently defined attachment styles: It was so inconsistent as to be self-contradictory. This is the defining trait of a disorganised attachment style: the incoherent and contradictory urges and feelings dominate the minds of people who form attachments in this way.</p>

<p>Some of the behaviours that might be noticed during infancy include these contradictions, such as a baby showing significant distress when a caregiver leaves them alone but responding with indifference or resistance when the caregiver returns. They may even choose to seek the attention or care of strangers in lieu of their caregiver. Visible distress, excessive crying, turning away from their caretakers, or looking off into space when they are trying to interact with the baby might be signs present under one year of age.</p>

<p>Additionally, babies might already have a 'freeze' reaction at a very young age - rendering them unsure of what to do and stuck to the spot or starting to move and then stopping many times over. They may engage in self-injurious or reckless behaviour that is atypical for their age.</p>

<p>The clearest indicator of any kind of disorganised attachment forming in an infant would definitely be any sort of fear or apprehension of the parent or caregiver. This can happen for reasons other than abuse or trauma, but fear is where the disorganised attachment style originates.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Disorganised Attachment in Children</h2>
<p>The characteristics of disorganised attachment in children are similar to that of infants but with more animation and agency. Whilst babies tend to show distress or avoidance through crying or looking away; children develop more tools to express themselves and get their needs met as they grow up.</p>

<p>Children of this attachment style may be prone to acting out in various ways in an effort to get attention and validation, which they are not getting in sufficient amounts from their caregiver. More so, their behaviour may appear designed to harvest attention, when in reality, their emotional regulation skills and ability to self-soothe are just very underdeveloped.</p>

<p>They also tend to be avoidant of certain emotional situations and conversely form intense areas of focus that can border on obsessive at times. There is little in-between for these children.</p>

<p>Similarly, the relationship with their caretakers tends to be very hot and cold, push and pull - and the child does not develop the awareness of society to disguise their side of that equation in public until later in childhood. This is part of the reason that child psychologists think that observing attachment behaviours in children under three years old is so important; caregivers can and do teach children to 'behave' in public and conceal their feelings and struggles as much as possible. Children living with profound fear, as most disorganised children are, are more likely to be compliant with this kind of inauthentic shaping from adults.</p>

<p>Further complicating matters and adding to the perception of disorganised attachment resulting in attention-seeking behaviours is the universal difficulty these children have with communicating their own needs. Because they have been shown that they cannot rely on their caregivers for their needs to be met, they often have a lot of complicated and distressing emotions around even asking for basic necessities. This specificity is set amongst a backdrop of generalised fear, anxiety, confusion, and ambivalence.</p>

<p>A casual observer might simply describe a child with a disorganised attachment style as being 'all over the place.'</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Disorganised Attachment in Adults</h2>
<p>Depending on which attachment theory is being used and which study is being referenced, the estimates for the percentage of adults in Western countries with a disorganised attachment style range from one per cent to 15 per cent.</p>

<p>This wide range represents the confusion and uncertainty surrounding how to identify and diagnose this attachment style. Adults with disorganised attachment styles tend to have rather low self-esteem and are extremely anxious about the intentions and ulterior motives of others. They usually struggle pretty intensely with emotional regulation, which contributes to their struggles with focus and experiences of fear surrounding important relationships. They either want extreme closeness and a lot of attention or total isolation. We will cover some more information about these individuals in the last section of this module.</p>
