            <h2>Lesson 2: Basics of Attachment Theory </h2>

            <h3>UNDERSTANDING ATTACHMENT THEORY</h3>
<p>
Attachment theory can be an interesting topic and has helped psychiatrists understand what causes current issues with their adult patient's mental health. Many people, even those who are experts in the field, will question the individual's relationship with their mother whenever they notice issues such as anger, depression, or moodiness. If you look at Bowlby's explanation of the stages of attachment, it seems obvious that having a mother who wasn't present in your life during your earliest years could have a damaging effect on your overall emotional wellbeing later in life.
</p>
<p>
But, at the same time, when you look at other observations of attachment theory, such as Schaffer and Emerson's study, it is understood that the fault doesn't lie primarily on the mother or even on both parents. However, it could be anyone the child became connected to whilst still an infant.

But, at the same time, when you look at other observations of attachment theory, such as Schaffer and Emerson's study, it is understood that the fault doesn't lie primarily on the mother or even on both parents. However, it could be anyone the child became connected to whilst still an infant.
</p>
<p>
Bowlby theorised that the intense behaviours small children engage in to avoid any separation from their mom or dad, or when they are reconnecting with a physically separated parent—such as crying, clinging, or screaming—were all evolutionary processes. Bowlby stated that these unruly behaviours were possibly reinforced through natural selection and helped to promote the child's chances of survival.
</p>
<p>
It is believed that the behaviours associated with attachment are our automatic responses to the threat of losing our survival advantages, and that these go along with being attended to and cared for by a caregiver such as a mum or a dad. Because the infants who engaged in these behaviours were considered more likely to survive, the instincts were reinforced over the generations.
</p>
<p>
Attachment theory continues to be studied and analysed by experts as we learn more about how we adapt to changes in our lives over the years. It makes sense that a baby's attachment style is greatly influenced by the level of care, attention, and compassion they receive in their earliest years. Those who received an abundance of support and love from their caregivers are likely to grow up to be more confident individuals. In contrast, those who were often neglected by their caregivers will have more issues with anxiety, especially when it comes to their relationship with their parents.
</p>

<h2>WHAT IS THE FORMATION OF ATTACHMENT?</h2>
<p>
There are two main theories associated with the formation of attachment: Behaviourist and Evolutionary. With behaviourist attachment, the baby will form an attachment to the individual that feeds and nurtures them. They associate the care their caregiver provides with the comfort of being fed.
</p>
<p>
This is the process of learning attachment via classic conditioning. Babies also learn about various behaviours, such as crying or laughing, and how they can elicit different responses from their caregivers. Therefore, they will repeat these behaviours through operant conditioning to obtain the desired results.
</p>
<p>
With the evolutionary theory of attachment, it is believed that babies come into the world already programmed to form a bond with others, such as their mother and father. These attachments will play a key role in helping them survive. The baby will produce these natural behaviours, such as crying or cooing, to stimulate an accurate response from their caregiver. This type of behaviour is known in psychology as social releasers.
</p>
<p>
The determinant of attachment in terms of evolutionary theory is not the provision of food but instead care and responsiveness. Based on Bowlby's theory, the infant will first create one attachment, known as the monotropy, and that attachment acts as a base throughout their childhood years. It will help them learn how to explore the world around them and survive.
</p>
<p>
The relationship that is formed with the child's caregiver, or in many cases, their mother, plays a critical role in how the child forms and maintains relationships in the future. Therefore, interfering with or attempting to alter this will only lead to emotional difficulties for the child as they get older. They may have problems maintaining healthy relationships with other family members, friends, and romantic partners.
</p>
<p>
This theory also argues that there is a critical period in our lives where it is important to develop a strong and healthy attachment to others. That period occurs between birth and five years of age. If there is no significant or healthy relationship formed during this period, it is believed that the child will endure irreversible developmental issues that may include reduced intelligence or an increase in aggressive behaviour.
