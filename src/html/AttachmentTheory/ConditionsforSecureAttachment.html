            <h2>Lesson 2: Conditions for Secure Attachment </h2> <br>

            <h2>Early Childhood</h2>

<p>Now that we have learnt about the characteristics of people with secure attachment styles, let's discuss the conditions that caregivers can provide to help their children develop this healthy pattern of being in a relationship with others.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>Foundational to the development of secure attachment is the feeling of safety when caregivers are near-typically, this needs to be present in early infancy for children to continue to feel safe throughout the rest of their childhood.
This can be achieved through careful attention to the child, allowing for independent growth and exploration whilst remaining a nearby and protective presence.</p>

<p>Additionally, basic needs, such as shelter and food being adequately met, help a child feel safe with caregivers. Sometimes, events out of the parents' control can disrupt either basic needs or physical security for the child, and re-establishing secure attachment must first begin with a rebuilding of the basic sense of safety and protection when parents or other caregivers are nearby.</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>Put more simply; validation is the feeling of being seen and known. In the context of early childhood attachment patterns, this is largely impacted by how well caregivers respond to the cries and other non-verbal communications of children. The goal is for the infant or child to inherently understand that they can get their needs met by communicating with caregivers. This is how infants begin to develop a sense of autonomy and self, so it is vital for those caring for them to interpret their attempts at communication appropriately.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many different circumstances can interrupt or complicate the communication between babies and their caregivers. It's important to quickly return to a baseline response of acknowledgement and compassionate action to take care of their needs when these disruptions occur.</p>

<h2>Comfort and Reassurance</h2>

<p>Similar to the condition of children feeling safe, the required condition of these young individuals feeling comforted and reassured during times of distress is paramount to developing a secure attachment style.</p>

<p>Caregivers can show children comfort by being there for them when they have a hard day, a disagreement, or are dealing with any kind of distress or trauma. A warm and compassionate demeanour in the face of their difficulties helps soothe them and, over time, builds a foundation of emotional regulation, which they can then pattern in their own behaviours.</p>

<h2>Feeling Valued</h2>

<p>Just as a caregiver's approach to comforting their child builds the foundation for that child's own emotional regulation down the road, the way that a caregiver demonstrates the value of their children will play a significant role in the development of their self-image and esteem. This sense of self starts to develop when people are just babies, and they are much more likely to become securely attached adults if their caregivers express pride, joy and satisfaction with who their child is becoming. The idea is very much that their existence and personhood have value, and less so that their value is determined by accomplishments or milestones.</p>

<h2>Support in Exploration</h2>

<p>It is important for children to begin to develop a sense of independence and curiosity for secure attachment styles to form. This can be supported by caregivers allowing and encouraging them to safely explore their surroundings whilst staying close to provide support if needed. This also includes introducing new toys, games or ideas to children and letting them figure out some of those things autonomously.</p>

<h2>Bringing Secure Attachment into Adulthood</h2>

<h3>The Extreme Importance of Trust</h3>

<p>Now that we have learnt about the discrete feelings that securely attached children need to experience regarding their caregivers, let's discuss the binding and somewhat more amorphous component that ties all of those feelings together: trust.</p>

<p>Trust can only be developed and reinforced via repeated and reliable interactions and generally is best built when there is a consistent baseline throughout a relationship. This does not mean that any mistake or variance results in broken trust; rather, a clear idea of what a child can expect as baseline behaviour and responses from their caregiver must be shared. Once there is a clearer understanding of what is 'normal', many children have a much easier time reconnecting and trusting again after a difficulty.</p>

<p>Inconsistency in parenting strategy is probably one of the most significant possible barriers to trust between a child and their parent.
When children know what to expect, they are usually less anxious and better able to emotionally regulate, either with caregivers or independently.</p>

<p>Another significant barrier to building trust with children can be the caregiver's own insecure attachment styles or lack of emotional awareness. Again, this comes down to an issue of consistency-as people who are less aware of their own emotional state tend to behave in more volatile ways. Therapy, self-help, support groups and other forms of counselling might help individuals who are experiencing difficulties with their own emotions during parenting.</p>

<p>Finally, trust is bolstered by modelling positive behaviours and attitudes. A caregiver's calm and hopeful outlook on life can help children to trust that this person has their best interests in mind and can be relied upon to respond in fairly consistent ways. Parents should not agonise over every single interaction with their child or display a lot of anxiety over whether they are parenting 'right.' Whilst these concerns are completely understandable and valid, it is important to display a confident and relaxed demeanour when actually interacting with the child.</p>

<h2>Developing Secure Attachment in Adulthood</h2>

<h3>Attachment Styles are Fluid</h3>

<p>Even though attachment style begins to form at such a young age, research has shown that it can change throughout childhood and even into adulthood. Many different traumatic or disruptive events can have a significant impact on an otherwise securely attached child-leading to some form of insecure attachment style. Similarly, a close relationship with a person who has a secure attachment style might enable an otherwise insecurely attached person to develop more securely attached characteristics and behaviours.</p>

<p>These changes are often unintentional, both towards and away from secure attachment. However, most psychologists agree that adults with insecure attachment styles usually need to intentionally approach the root causes of their relational patterns to make a consistent and independently resilient change towards more security.</p>

<h2>Shifting Towards Security</h2>

<p>The first step toward a more secure attachment style is to take inventory and make sense of the ways that one interacts with their relationships and loved ones.
Understanding behavioural patterns and cycles that may have existed throughout their entire life can't help the individual understand which specific insecure attachment style they are living with, which will indicate what areas of growth need the most attention. Trying to remember and analyse childhood experiences is especially important.</p>

<p>Once these patterns have been acknowledged, individuals must attempt to shift their perspective and truly internalise the ideas that their past experiences do not have to dictate their current life. Beyond these foundational steps, the process that every individual will need to navigate towards a more secure attachment style will vary based on their attachment style and experiences.</p>

<p>We have now concluded the section on secure attachment types. Upcoming modules will discuss attachment styles in adulthood in more detail.</p>
