            <h2>Lesson 1:  Criticisms of Attachment Theory</h2>
            <p>We begin this module with an in-depth discussion of the criticisms and limitations of attachment theory.</p>
<p>This will include a review of one of the primary critics, J.R. Harris, who felt that attachment theory relied too heavily on what she identified as the 'nurture assumption.' We will then review the limitations of experiments that only observe subjects during stressful situations, as well as the potential shortfalls of presuming the default primary caregiver to be a mother.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will discuss how children form many different attachments throughout their development, starting from a very young age, and the lack of consideration for this in attachment theory. Finally, we will review the many other sociological and environmental factors that attachment theory does not consider and discuss the limitations of the ideas for applications in non-Western cultures or family structures that deviate from those studied by Bowlby and Ainsworth.</p>

<h2>J.R. Harris and the 'Nurture Assumption'</h2>
<p>Attachment theory is arguably a complex way of explaining an age-old idea, which is the hereditary nature of certain personality traits or relational patterns. People have long believed that cruel, impatient and rude parents will raise unruly and impolite children and that kind, loving, and patient parents will beget well-behaved children. However, this is often not the case.</p>
<p>Harris wrote in 1998 about her criticisms of attachment theory, primarily that it is commonly believed by psychologists and laymen alike that "nature gives parents a baby: the end result depends on how they nurture it. Good nurturing can make up for many of nature's mistakes: lack of nurturing can trash nature's best effort."</p>
<p>She goes on to explain that this idea is based on the linking of concepts of nurture and environment—which she sees as independently related components of a person's perceptions. The interchangeable use of 'nurture' and 'environment' leads to an overstated influence of caregiver interactions and a lack of consideration for other environmental factors.</p>
<p>She dubbed this misguided idea the 'nurture assumption' and further went on to explore examples of nature, likely linked to genetics, playing a larger role in personality traits and habits than the home environment, as well as incidences of other environmental factors causing clear differentiation in observable effect and behaviours. The idea that all, or even most, of the environmental influence comes from caregivers is a huge burden for one or two people to bear, and they can often wind up over-worrying about every missed opportunity to properly model and perform secure attachment behaviours.</p>

<h2>Overemphasis on Stressful Situations Only</h2>
<p>Another limitation of attachment theory is its basis on experiments that only observed behaviours in infants and caregivers during stressful situations, which does not give a complete picture of their overall relational patterns the rest of the time. A psychologist named Tiffany Field wrote in 1996 that "a broader understanding of attachment requires observation of how the mother and infant interact and what they provide for each other during natural, non-stressful situations."</p>

<h2>Assumption of Mother as Primary Caregiver</h2>
<p>Whilst it is not explicitly stated in much of the currently available information about attachment theory, these ideas were certainly developed with the presumption of a mother-figure being the default primary caregiver. The detrimental effect of this assumption is two-fold, resulting in both a bias towards non-nuclear family arrangements within attachment theory, and a disconnect in the applicability of attachment theory for those who grew up with primary caregivers who were not at least serving in the role of a mother-figure.</p>

<h2>Children Form Many Different Attachments</h2>
<p>An additional area in which attachment theory seems to lack significant consideration is that of the additional and various relational attachments that children form with both adults other than their primary and secondary caregivers and their peers. Psychologists, such as Field, also pointed this out in their criticisms of attachment theory, arguing that the list of attachment behaviours from which theorists made their attachment style classifications left out many of the psychological and subtle responses that likely impact emotional disposition and behaviours.</p>
<p>A study at the University of Utah in 2013 also found that the same individual can experience different attachment styles in different relationships simultaneously. This finding somewhat blows the lid off the concept of attachment theory as being fixed in the moment but fluid over time. Instead, it suggests that most people adapt their attachment behaviours in response to a variety of factors, which are often specific to certain people they are interacting with.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bowlby's theory of attachment suggested that the development of attachment style ends sometime during puberty. Later attachment theories made some room for the continuing development of attachment style beyond this young age, but the focus remained on very young children. Some professionals feel that this does not account for the significant influences of environment and peers during late childhood and early adulthood, as well as the later formation of attachments within one's own potential family.</p>

<h2>Attachment Theory Ignores Sociological and Environmental Factors</h2>
<p>In addition to the limitations listed above, many researchers and other professionals have criticised the overall lack of consideration for variation in social class, gender, ability, culture, ethnicity, and sexuality—particularly lacking any perspective on family and relationship dynamics outside of Western and Eurocentric ideas. The original studies were performed with a vast majority of subjects who fell into a narrow field of identity and maintained nuclear family models.</p>
<p>Psychologists, such as Harris, believe that peer pressure and behaviour geared towards 'fitting in' determines a lot of children's personality development, which is supported by the fact that behavioural and parenting norms are not synonymous across cultures. Children growing up with peers who are always getting into trouble tend to have higher rates of delinquency themselves, and this pattern is usually reversed if the child is moved to a situation with more well-behaved peers. For this reason, and many others, social class (including the material resources available to the caregivers) is also argued to play a very significant role.</p>
<p>There's also a disconnect between the reality of relationships in different cultures and the all-encompassing worldview that attachment theory purports. For example, in Japanese culture, it is very common for children to gain independence from a very young age, running errands and riding public transportation alone.</p>
<p>Without cultural context, someone observing a Japanese family might mistake the child for having an avoidant attachment style, even if the rest of their behaviours and inner perceptions about the world don't match up with the overall picture of that attachment style.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some families and cultures that value raising children in communal or shared caregiving dynamics. Attachment theory hardly knows how to regard these situations, and strict practitioners may be inclined to see disorganised attachment styles more readily due to the lack of perspective on these situations available in attachment literature.</p>
<p>Finally, there have been times when professionals have wielded attachment theory in ways intended to problematise sexual behaviours or preferences that deviate from the norm. This has extended to core identities, such as homosexuality as well as fetishes and other behaviour. Labelling unusual behaviour as inherently pathological can certainly enable fanatics to apply this analysis to people who they do not morally approve of in order to identify them as 'broken'. There are many different issues with this approach, the foremost being that sexualities other than heterosexuality are not mental health concerns, and in most cases, neither are fetishes.</p>
