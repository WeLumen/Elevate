            <h2>Lesson 1: Early Development of Avoidant Attachment </h2>

            <p>Let's get started by learning about the early development of avoidant attachment in babies.</p>
<p>As with all attachment styles, avoidant attachment usually begins to form very early in a child's life. This module will examine the circumstances and caregiver behaviours that can lead to this happening.</p>

<h2>Caregiver Behaviours</h2>
<p>Because attachment styles pertain to the relational patterns and rules that people learn from birth, caregiver behaviour and connection with their child has a significant influence on the development of avoidant attachment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is not the excessive physical absence of parents or caregivers or straightforward neglect that leads to an avoidant attachment style. Instead, this situation arises when infants and young children behave in anxiously attached ways and experience undesirable consequences or if caregivers are simply emotionally closed off.</p>
<p>Parents who avoid difficult conversations, don't talk to children about their own emotions or are apparently uncomfortable with the child's own emotions frequently lack the emotional availability to foster a secure attachment. They might also explicitly discourage children from expressing their own emotions and difficulties, which can lead to a dissonance between the child's instinctual need for intimacy and the expectations of independence and maturity from their caregivers. This mismatch can be very confusing for developing minds and can easily lead them to also close themselves off emotionally and form avoidant behaviours.</p>
<p>Caregivers who themselves have avoidant attachment styles are likely to pass this trait on to their children, as discussed in Module 4. They are often easily overwhelmed and are inclined to withdraw as emotional interactions become more intense, which can result in poor responsiveness to the immediate emotional needs of their child. On the other hand, they can also respond with anger or irritation when overwhelmed, which even further solidifies the foundation of avoidant attachment in the child on the receiving end of that anger.</p>

<h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
<p>There are certainly many different situations that are out of the discrete control of caregivers and parents and which can lead to avoidant attachment. Barriers, such as having to work stressful or demanding jobs to materially provide for a family, the lack of community support for caregivers, and various disabilities, can all exacerbate the difficulty of being emotionally available enough to form a secure attachment with an infant. Some studies have indicated that countries with longstanding and strong maternal leave policies and other systemic support for new families have lower incidences of mental illnesses associated with various insecure attachment styles.</p>
<p>It is important to reiterate that no childhood or parenting approach is absolutely perfect, and small mistakes here and there do not solidify insecure attachment styles. The situations described in this section are just some of the factors that psychologists and researchers have found are common amongst those with avoidant attachment.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on blame or shame for caregivers, it is most important to first identify and then address any external barriers and internal emotional issues so that they can provide their potential best to their child.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Avoidant Attachment</h2>
<p>Now that you know all about the circumstances that can lead children to develop an avoidant attachment style, let's talk about the characteristics that psychologists and other professionals have observed in people with this attachment style. We will review the distinctions for infants, children and adults.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Avoidant Attachment in Infants</h2>
<p>During the phase that Bowlby defined as the 'Attachment in Making' phase, it can be difficult to discern the attachment style since babies are still developing the capacity to acknowledge or differentiate any kind of attachment.</p>
<p>Whilst babies of this age may display characteristics of avoidant attachment, such as suppressing their own crying or shying away from physical contact, their behaviour may fluctuate quite a bit during this time. This should not necessarily be regarded as an indicator of attachment style throughout the rest of childhood or adulthood.</p>
<p>Around eight months of age, babies begin the 'Clear-Cut' attachment phase, and their patterns begin to become more comprehensive. An infant who is likely developing an avoidant attachment style in this phase might appear to self-soothe when upset instead of crying out for care and may be uncomfortable receiving care or physical contact. Another indicator would be a muted display of any kind of emotion—including joy and other positive feelings—and a focus on the tangible.</p>
<p>Babies who become extremely focused on their toys and do not want to play interactive games may also be forming this attachment style. They may also display more pseudo-independence—preferring to explore, learn or play on their own, instead of with the close supervision or guidance of caregivers.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Avoidant Attachment in Children</h2>
<p>Once young children begin to walk, speak, and interact with people outside of their family more often, the presence of an avoidant attachment style will be much more obvious. They tend to prefer doing things as independently as possible—and usually not because they genuinely enjoy it or know how to do everything—but rather because they are worried about relying on caregivers or others to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Another characteristic is the appearance of a lack of emotional needs and, in fact, emotions. This does not mean the child is actually lacking emotional capacity; instead, these behaviours indicate the child's confusion and distress surrounding emotions in general. Whilst some avoidant attachment styles present as emotional maturity in children—and this can lead to confusion with a secure attachment style—some children develop such severe avoidant attachment at an early age that they are unusually socially withdrawn.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of Avoidant Attachment in Adults</h2>
<p>Adults with an avoidant attachment style are estimated to make up about 23 per cent of the adult population of western countries where this research has been conducted. Unlike the two other insecure attachment styles, avoidant often does not result in adults feeling consciously socially or emotionally inhibited. Instead, much of the difficulty is experienced by others who may try to form intimate or interdependent bonds with these individuals.</p>
<p>The strong sense of independence and individualism, which defines an avoidant attachment style, can lead their romantic partners, close friends and family to feel lonely and emotionally neglected in their company. Because these individuals also tend to prioritise many things in their lives above relationships and communication—paths to remedy this distance may not be readily apparent or easy to access. As a result, they may have very few close relationships even if they are apparently social and likeable.</p>
<p>On the positive side, people with avoidant attachment styles tend to have high self-esteem and do not need validation from their relationships to maintain this. They may be very well-liked and have a lot of friendships and romantic partners, even if they are mostly superficial. These adults find it easier to focus on career and personal development than relationships, so much of their self-worth and values come from their vocational activities.</p>
