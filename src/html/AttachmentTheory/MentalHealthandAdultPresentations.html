            <h2>Lesson 2: Mental Health and Adult Presentations</h2>

            <h3>MENTAL HEALTH IN DISORGANISED ATTACHMENT STYLES</h3>
<p>
Now that we have examined the common traits and behaviours common in individuals with a disorganised attachment style, let's review the overall impacts on mental health that this kind of attachment behaviour may be correlated with.
</p>

<h2>THE FREEZE RESPONSE AND TRAUMA-INFORMED PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<p>
As explained in previous modules, trauma is the human response to a deeply distressing event or circumstance that overwhelms an individual's ability to cope and maintain normal functioning. This can include violence or injury but can also be triggered by emotional abuse, neglect, loss, and other intense events.
</p>
<p>
The freeze trauma response usually arises when the individual has either already tried flight and fight with no success, or they have had so many contradictory experiences that their nervous system automatically goes into a state of hypo-arousal, or lowered activity, during extremely distressing periods. Outwardly, this may look like someone staring into space, not adequately responding to their surroundings, moving very slowly, and struggling to speak or to process sensory input.
</p>
<p>
People with disorganised attachment styles are prone to this trauma response because their attempts to self-regulate or seek care have been so confusing that their nervous system is trying to protect them by conserving energy and revoking emotional connection to lower the intensity of the situation.
</p>

<h2>DISORDERS RELATED TO EMOTIONAL DYSREGULATION</h2>
<p>
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or the newer label of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), are both positively correlated with having a disorganised attachment style during childhood. In addition, research has found ties to depression, substance abuse disorders, anxiety disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Additionally, a possible link between Attention Deficit Disorder and other attention or focus-related disorders is being investigated.
</p>

<h2>DISORGANISED ATTACHMENT IN ADULT RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>
Now that we have reviewed the mental health impacts of a disorganised attachment style, let's review the ways that it can show up and interfere with adult relationships, focusing on sexual or romantic relationships.
</p>
<p>
As described previously, the overriding theme is the lack of coherence—and this holds true in romantic relationships for an adult with a disorganised attachment style.
</p>
<p>
They may deeply wish to belong, whilst also having a strong urge to avoid abandonment and harm. Similar to avoidantly attached individuals—they tend to avoid close proximity to intimacy—but the difference is that the disorganised attached adult actually wants to have intimate relationships underneath their fear.
</p>
<p>
Because these individuals expect the worst: rejection, betrayal, abandonment, and more, they can unintentionally sabotage relationships they do attempt to form. Barriers to trust are high, and they have a very hard time taking their partners at their word regarding the future or their feelings for them.
</p>
<p>
This lack of trust can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy as they perform endless 'tests' of their partners, which can erode the connection over time. They can also find themselves attracted to objectively unsafe people due to the patterns they learned during childhood and their difficulties discerning trust.
</p>
<p>
Their vacillation between fierce independence and anxious co-dependency can be difficult to navigate within the confines of intimacy and the communication required for an effective romantic and sexual relationship.
