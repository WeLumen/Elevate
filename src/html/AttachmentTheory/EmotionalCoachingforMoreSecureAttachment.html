            <h2>Lesson 1: Emotional Coaching for More Secure Attachment</h2>

            <p>To begin this module, we start with an in-depth discussion of the various emotional coaching and support strategies that caregivers and other adults may implement to help children learn more securely attached behaviours. This will include a definition and exploration of emotional regulation as a teachable skill, as well as a discussion of the importance of trust and respect in emotional coaching dynamics. We will then review the vital caregiver actions of displaying empathy and modelling emotional regulation for their children and how other adults can introduce these elements later in a child's life. Finally, we will review the process of problem-solving difficult emotions or behaviours with children in a constructive and effective way. Let's begin by discussing emotional regulation.</p>

<h2>Emotional Regulation Can Be Taught</h2>

<p>Even though attachment styles have been shown to have a significant influence on a child's ability to emotionally regulate, it is important to remember that attachment styles are fluid.</p>

<p>And more importantly—emotional regulation can be taught and learned by children of most ages through a variety of techniques and approaches. It should also be noted that some studies have shown that emotional regulation capacity is a strong mediator between childhood insecure attachment and adulthood mental health diagnoses such as depression and anxiety. Even if a child's primary caregiver is not able to offer support about learning emotional regulation, outside support with these skills can decrease the probability of adverse and potentially pathological mental health effects.</p>

<p>Emotional regulation skills can involve a wide variety of approaches, and different skills will work better for children with different attachment patterns. Much of the characteristic behaviours associated with insecure attachment styles are actually maladaptive attempts at emotional regulation, so the key is to slowly introduce replacement coping strategies that are more effective.</p>

<p>For avoidant attachment styles, they are likely to need support with identifying and accepting emotions instead of pushing them away or dissociating. For ambivalent attachment, children are more prone to over-expression of emotion and may benefit from learning how to anticipate and cope ahead with their emotional responses or techniques to lower their emotional vulnerabilities in general. Children with a disorganised attachment style often need a mixture of these two styles, plus a lot of help in recognising when they are emotionally activated in the first place. Skills like self-soothing and building positive relational experiences can also help to create a safer baseline for any insecurely attached child to regulate their emotions from.</p>

<h2>Building Trust and Respect</h2>

<p>For most children with insecure attachment styles, little emotional work can be done with them until there has been a strong foundation of trust and respect established between the child and whichever adult is attempting to support them. Respect must be a two-way street in these kinds of dynamics, and insecurely attached children are much less likely to give respect in interactions in which they do not perceive respect for themselves.</p>

<p>Understandably, the process of developing trust and respect can be difficult and take a significant amount of time. Further, it might require different approaches for the various attachment styles.</p>

<p>Children with avoidant attachment styles can easily feel belittled by offers of support since they generally have a positive self-evaluation and do not see their coping behaviours as maladaptive. It can be effective to commend their efforts to stay under control whilst also giving them permission to not always be in control and to establish a trusting relationship with reliable emotional affect even when they withdraw.</p>

<p>Ambivalently attached children are more likely to cling to adults who show interest in them, but any dissatisfaction or discipline may be interpreted as complete rejection—resulting in broken trust or a perceived disrespect. Reassurance that is not condescending or pandering is essential to retaining a continuous relationship for long enough to build trust strong enough to withstand necessary reprimands or corrections, and to demonstrate a respect for the child's perspective.</p>

<p>Children with a disorganised attachment may respond very differently to the same sort of stimuli or support efforts, depending on which part of their emotional spectrum they are falling on that day. In order to build trust with these children, adults must remain consistent in their reactions even in the face of that hot and cold dynamic. Adults can also show respect by validating these emotions and offering to provide the same kind of support regardless of which emotion is showing up that day.</p>

<h2>Empathy and Emotional Modelling</h2>

<p>Much like behavioural characteristics, emotional responses and characteristics are influenced by the ways that adults and older children model emotions in the presence of a child. Indeed, many of the struggles associated with insecure attachments are tied directly to ineffective emotional modelling by caregivers at a very young age.</p>

<p>One of the most important emotions to model for children with insecure attachment styles is empathy. This may be an emotion that was either absent or inconsistently present in their interactions with their caregivers—and empathetic perspectives on other people play a key role in secure attachment.</p>

<h2>Problem Solving Difficult Emotions or Behaviours</h2>

<p>Children with insecure attachment styles are prone to ineffective and potentially disruptive behaviours. In order for them to develop better coping skills and potentially grow into a more secure attachment style, these issues must be approached with patience and in a manner that is consistent with the relationship-building discussed in previous sections.</p>

<p>These goals can be accomplished through a skill called problem-solving—which is both teachable to older children and useful for adults trying to navigate these situations.</p>

<p>The first step in problem-solving is to identify the issue—usually, this is some sort of emotional response to a situation. Identifying both the event and the emotion, as well as the intensity of that emotion, is important. From there, adults can work with a child to check the facts surrounding their interpretation of the event and the cause of their emotions.</p>

<p>For instance, does an ambivalently attached child feel like they are being rejected because they were reprimanded by a teacher? It would be helpful to identify whether the teacher was factually rejecting the child or just asking for different behaviour. After checking the facts, different behavioural techniques and coping skills can be used based on how justified the emotion is in that current moment.</p>

<p>The skill of problem-solving can help children learn how to choose which coping skills to use instead of defaulting to maladaptive norms of their attachment style. It can also help to foster a more communicative and respectful relationship between children and adults, as they work together to resolve difficult behaviours. Many studies have shown that agency and input from children are essential for effective emotional coaching.</p>
