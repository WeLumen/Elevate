            <h2>Lesson 2: The Eight Stages</h2>

            <p>Erik Erikson is accredited with creating one of the most important theories that focuses on human development. Sigmund Freud had a massive influence on Erikson's research, but he eventually went in a different direction, focusing more on the social aspect of human development.</p>

<p>Erikson's theory, unlike Freud's psychosexual phases hypothesis, basically tried to explain the effect of social experiences over a length of time.</p>

<h2>PART 2: THE EIGHT STAGES</h2>

<p>Erikson was fascinated by how human development and growth were influenced by social contact and relationships.</p>

<p>Erikson's theory depends on the previous phases and prepares the ground for subsequent periods of development. Erikson felt that humans go through a struggle at each stage that acts as a tipping point in their development.</p>

<p>These conflicts, according to Erikson, are concentrated on either developing or failing to develop a psychological trait. The possibility for self-improvement is tremendous during these periods, but then, so is the possibility of failure.</p>

<p>People who effectively manage conflict have developed self-confidence, which will benefit them for the rest of their lives. They may not acquire the necessary abilities for a robust sense of identity if they are unable to successfully cope with conflicts.</p>

<p>A sense of competence, according to Erikson, inspires behaviours and acts. Erikson's theory is divided into stages, each of which is focused on gaining competence in a certain area of life.</p>

<p>Each person will have a sense of accomplishment if a phase is managed properly; this is sometimes alluded to as ego power or ego quality. The individual will feel insufficient in an area of progress if that phase is not handled effectively.</p>

<h2>TRUST VS MISTRUST</h2>

<p>According to Erikson, the phase between birth and one year is extremely essential and might even be considered to be the most important in psychosocial development. Because a baby is fully dependent, the caretakers' dependability and competence are critical in developing confidence.</p>

<p>The child is completely reliant on caring adults for all they require at this stage of development, especially nourishment, love, shelter, safety, and caring. If a caretaker fails to provide appropriate care and affection, the child will begin to believe that they cannot trust or rely on the people in their lives.</p>

<p>If a youngster builds trust effectively, they will feel secure in the environment. Children's sentiments of distrust are exacerbated by caretakers who are unreliable, emotionally unavailable, or dismissive.</p>

<p>Fear and the perception that the world is unreliable and unpredictable will arise if trust is not developed. When caregivers provide consistency, care, and affection, children acquire a sense of trust throughout the initial stage of their psychological development. Mistrust will result if this isn't done.</p>

<p>No youngster will ever develop a feeling of complete trust or complete scepticism. Erikson thought that the key to effective growth was achieving a compromise between the conflicting forces. When this occurs, infants develop hope, which Erikson defined as "a receptivity to experience moderated by some fear of risk."</p>

<h2>AUTONOMY VS SHAME AND DOUBT</h2>

<p>Early childhood is the subject of Erikson's second stage of psychosocial development, which focuses on children gaining a larger feeling of personal control.</p>

<p>Children are just beginning to obtain some independence at this stage of development. They are beginning to perform basic acts on their own and make rudimentary selections about their preferences. Parents and caregivers may allow children to develop a feeling of autonomy by enabling them to make decisions and acquire control.</p>

<p>The main objective of this plan is for children to have a sense of self-control over their physical abilities as well as independence. Potty training aids in the development of this sense of independence in youngsters.</p>

<p>Erikson, like Freud, thought that toilet training was an important part of the process. Erikson's logic, on the other hand, differed significantly from that of Sigmund Freud. Learning to manage one's body functions, Erikson felt, increases a sense of independence and freedom.</p>

<p>Gaining more influence over food preferences, toy preferences, and clothes choosing are other significant occurrences.</p>

<p>Children who have difficulty with different things and who are chastised for their mistakes may lose their sense of self-control. Success leads to sentiments of autonomy throughout this period of psychological development; failure leads to feelings of guilt and mistrust.</p>

<p>Children who finish this stage feel comfortable and protected, but those who do not are left feeling insecure and self-conscious. Erikson felt that striking the right balance between independence and shame and doubt would build will or the conviction that children can act with purpose, within reason and boundaries.</p>

<h2>INITIATIVE VS GUILT</h2>

<p>During the years before school, the third stage of psychological development occurs. Children learn to establish their authority and control over their environment at this stage of psychological development by controlling play and other interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p>Children that succeed at this stage believe they are capable of leading others. Those who do not develop these abilities experience remorse, self-doubt, and demonstrate a lack of effort.</p>

<p>The third phase of the model emphasises the need for children to begin establishing control and authority over their surroundings. A sense of belonging emerges as a result of this stage's success. Children who try to wield too much authority are met with criticism, which leads to feelings of guilt.</p>

<p>The ego attribute known as 'purpose' occurs when a perfect mix of individual effort and a spirit of teamwork with others is reached.</p>

<h2>INDUSTRY VS INFERIORITY</h2>

<p>The fourth psychosocial stage occurs in the early school years, between the ages of five and 11. Children acquire a sense of confidence in their achievements and talents as a result of social interactions.</p>

<p>New academic and social expectations must be met by children. Failure leads to emotions of inferiority, whilst success leads to sentiments of competence.</p>

<p>Children who are praised and encouraged by their parents and instructors develop greater confidence in their own abilities. Those who get little or no support from their parents, instructors, or classmates will have doubts about their ability to succeed.</p>

<p>Finding a balance in this period of psychosocial development contributes to competence, a strength in which children acquire confidence in their skills to handle the responsibilities they are given.</p>

<h2>IDENTITY VS ROLE CONFUSION</h2>

<p>The fifth psychosocial stage occurs throughout the frequently tumultuous adolescent years. This period is critical in the development of an individual identity, which will impact a person's learning and behaviour for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Teenagers must develop a feeling of self and individuality. Failing leads to role ambiguity and a weakened sense of self, but success leads to the capacity to stay loyal to oneself.</p>

<p>Children explore their freedom and build a sense of self during adolescence. Those who are encouraged and reinforced appropriately via personal discovery will come from this stage with a powerful sense of identity and sentiments of autonomy and freedom.</p>

<p>Those who are unaware of their own views and desires will feel uneasy and uncertain about themselves and their future.</p>

<p>When psychologists talk about identity, they're referring to a person's entire body of concepts, attitudes, and factors that underpin and impact their behaviour.</p>

<p>After successfully completing this stage, Erikson defined fidelity as the capacity to live up to society's expectations and standards.</p>

<p>Whilst Erikson thought that each stage of psychological development was significant, he emphasised the formation of ego identity in particular. During the identity versus uncertainty stage of psychosocial development, ego identity is the conscious feeling of self that we build via social contact and becomes a key emphasis.</p>

<p>According to Erikson, our ego identity is always changing depending on our experiences and interactions with others in a social setting. As we experience new things, we also face problems that might aid or hinder our identity development.</p>

<p>Our personal identity provides each of us with a unified sense of self that lasts throughout our lifetimes. Our interactions and experiences with others develop our individual identity, and it is this individuality that guides our actions, attitudes, and behaviours as we grow older.</p>

<h2>INTIMACY VS ISOLATION</h2>

<p>Young adults require the development of close, caring connections with others. Failure leads to loneliness and isolation, whilst success leads to close relationships. This stage encompasses the early adult years when people are experimenting with intimate connections.</p>

<p>Erikson felt that developing intimate, dedicated connections with others was essential. Those that succeed at this level will develop long-lasting and stable partnerships.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that each level has a significant impact on the abilities you acquire in the next one. Erikson thought that forming close connections required a greater sense of self-identity. According to studies, those who have a low sense of self have fewer stable relationships and are more prone to experience emotional solitude, loneliness, and despair.</p>

<p>When this step is completed successfully, the virtue of love emerges. It is characterised by its ability to build long-term, meaningful connections with others.</p>

<h2>GENERATIVITY VS STAGNATION</h2>

<p>Adults must develop or nurture something that will outlast them, which they frequently do by having children or by making a beneficial change that benefits others. Failure leads to a superficial sense of connection in the world, whereas success leads to emotions of usefulness and achievement.</p>

<p>Those that succeed in this stage will feel as though they are making a difference in the world by becoming involved in their home and neighbourhood. Those who do not master this talent will feel useless and disconnected from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>When this step is successfully managed, the virtue of care is realised. This stage stresses being proud, watching your children develop into adults, and forming a bond with your life spouse.</p>

<h2>EGO INTEGRITY VS DESPAIR</h2>

<p>The last psychosocial stage comes in old age and is centred on life reflection. People at this stage of development reflect on the occurrences of their lives to see if they are satisfied with their lives or if they have regrets about the things that they did or did not do.</p>

<p>Erikson's theory was unique among others in that it addressed development across the lifetime, including old age. Older people need to reflect on their lives and feel fulfilled. At this stage, success brings sentiments of wisdom, but failure brings feelings of regret, anger, and despair.</p>

<p>At this point, individuals look back on their life and assess their accomplishments. Those who reflect on a life well-lived will feel fulfilled and ready to address the end of life with confidence. Those who think back with only regret will be afraid that...</p>
