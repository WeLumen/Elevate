            <h2>Lesson 1: Secure and Avoidant Attachment Styles</h2>

            <h3>ATTACHMENT STYLES ARE FLUID</h3>
<p>As we have learnt throughout this course, secure attachment styles are associated with several positive outcomes in adulthood. We will review some of these outcomes, as well as the overall worldview and disposition common amongst this population that might enable them to achieve these favourable outcomes.</p>

<h2>GENERAL DISPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<p>The securely attached adult tends to have a fairly positive view of both themselves and the people in their life, as well as a positive view of their childhood experiences. This leads to individuals who need minimal reassurance of their place in their world; they know that their existence has value and meaning without a lot of external validation. However, this lack of need for validation does not lead to social avoidance—rather, it empowers the securely attached adult to equally appreciate their time alone and time spent with others. They also tend to feel safer in new situations, are more willing to explore and experiment, and are more willing to face the inevitable changes that come with life. The lack of confusion or apprehension that they experience around their own childhood and early experiences grants securely attached adults a proclivity to optimism, satisfaction, self-reflection, and emotional problem-solving. Adults with secure attachment styles are typically able to regulate their emotions autonomously and effectively convey their needs in social situations. Their lives are all about the healthy balance between interdependency and independent satisfaction, and they are often described by people in their life as warm, laid-back, and lovable.</p>

<h2>GENERAL DISPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVE (continued)</h2>
<p>Adults with a secure attachment style are usually comfortable with social bonding, intimacy and long-term relationships, thanks to the emotional modelling and secure attachments they experience with their caregivers as children.</p>

<h2>DEVELOPING SECURE ATTACHMENT IN ADULTHOOD</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned in some previous modules, it is important to remember that secure attachment styles can be learnt and developed later in life. To begin the journey of healing, one must first take inventory of their current and past relationships in an attempt to sort out the ways that they interact with the various relationships in their life. Looking for behavioural patterns and picking apart cycles of behaviours that are likely so deeply engrained that they feel automatic is difficult, but it can help people identify their individual attachment styles and begin to unpack the areas that require growth and attention. Attempting to recount and understand childhood experiences is vital to this step, and a professional counsellor or therapist might be a helpful resource for those seeking to understand their attachment style. After patterns have been identified, adults have to do ongoing work to shift their perspectives to accept that their past experiences need not determine the path of their current life. Past the identification and broadening of perspective, the path that each person will need to travel to become more securely attached will vary based on their attachment style.</p>

<h2>AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT STYLE</h2>
<p>Now that you are aware of the profile of adults with a secure attachment style, let's talk about the characteristics and behaviours of adults with an avoidant attachment style. We will review their disposition, behavioural patterns in relationships, and the common experience of emotional shutdown.</p>

<h2>GENERAL DISPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVE</h2>
<p>For adults with avoidant attachment styles, the perspective of self is positive, and the perception of others and the world is generally negative. They have high self-esteem and confidence in moving through their lives and are often socially well-connected. In most cases, however, their friendships and romantic partnerships remain skin-deep, as they are not comfortable being emotionally vulnerable with others. Sometimes, this avoidance extends to emotional communication in general. Their lack of need for external validation means that they do not usually perceive a loss if their life is lacking in deeper social connections. These more intimate social connections are likely to be avoided or experienced with seemingly uncharacteristic difficulty. The people who attempt to get close to these individuals usually also experience quite a bit of difficulty and confusion. Adults with avoidant attachment often prefer to focus on their careers or personal development because much of their self-worth and values come from their independence and ability.</p>

<p>Level-headed and solution-oriented in times of crisis, they are often described as enjoyable and charming when emotions are light and pleasant. Their attachment style does not generally cause them distress until significant emotional bonds begin to form.</p>

<h2>RELATIONSHIP BEHAVIOURS</h2>
<p>Because avoidant attachment styles are characterised by independence to a fault paired with individualism, the romantic partners, close friends and family of adults with this attachment style can often feel emotionally cut off from their loved ones. Depending on the values of each individual, they may or may not prioritise repairs in relationships or even understand why their distance might be a problem for their loved ones. As a result, they might have a lot of social connections but with few close friends and possibly distant relationships with family or long-time friends. Another side effect of the independence combined with these adults' characteristic avoidance of emotional intimacy is the tendency to sabotage relationships when they start to become too close by pushing their partners away or provoking them into ending the relationship. Their problem-solving and rational approach to conflict, as well as a tendency to hide their own stress, may lead to their partners feeling invalidated or ignored about their own difficult emotions. Adults with an avoidant attachment style can even become frustrated or irritated with fairly low levels of relationship stress and may rush to end connections that feel difficult in any way.</p>

<h2>EMOTIONAL SHUTDOWN</h2>
<p>When faced with an intensely emotional situation, often even pleasant ones, many adults who have an avoidant attachment style will enter a state of emotional shutdown or emotional hypo-arousal. This means that they are experiencing, exhibiting, and often perceiving emotions in a diminished or muted way. For some people, this is an automatic response and happens without their choice; others will use it as a tool to avoid emotional intimacy. Either way, it is a maladaptive coping mechanism to deal with the fear of attachment wounding.</p>
