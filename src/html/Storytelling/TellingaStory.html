            <h2>Part 1: Telling a Story</h2>
            <p>Think about your life. Can you think of any stories that are important to you? Where did you first hear them? In what context?</p>

<p>Stories are essential to human experience and have been so for most of our existence because they help us understand our world. Knowing this foundation will help us put the right principles into place and tell more powerful stories as digital marketers. In this course, you will learn more about digital storytelling and understand its role in human history and cultural development.</p>

<h2>Why Storytelling Matters in Marketing</h2>
<p>Storytelling matters in marketing because the purpose of marketing is to change behavior and beliefs by earning attention and building trust.</p>

<p>Too much current marketing is focused on short-term, attention-grabbing tactics, which burn through trust. Whether our goal is to advance a mission or sell a product, we must make our marketing more emotional, creative, human, and focused on the long term. The answer, in part, is to tell more, and better, stories.</p>

<h2>Scientific Evidence</h2>
<p>Research has shown that storytelling is universal and a necessary evolutionary adaptation (Smith et al., 2017). A study conducted in 2013 (Zak, 2013) has found that a well-told story makes our brains produce oxytocin, the love hormone, and makes us have better feelings about the story we are hearing and the characters in it. The example used by the researchers is a video of a young boy with cancer. The video is narrated by the boy's father and tells how his son is dealing with the disease. After watching the story, a high percentage of the subjects decided to donate some of the money they made through the study to cancer research.</p>

<p>Another study discovered that different parts of our brains are activated when we hear different words. For example, when you hear a word like “coffee” the portions of your brain associated with food and color will be activated. This has allowed scientists to create semantic maps, which have allowed them to understand our brains even more (Huth, 2016).</p>

<h2>The Origin of Storytelling</h2>
<p>All human beings are storytellers at their core. Because of this, it is almost impossible to pinpoint the exact origin of stories and storytelling. We know that the first stories were oral tales shared between people, probably around a campfire or before sleeping for the night. Intrinsically, we also understand that the storytellers are an essential part of any human group and have played unique and often revered roles (Yong, 2017). Think of medieval bards, town criers, or authors as influential as Homer, who never actually wrote down his epic poems but traveled around Ancient Greece reciting them.</p>

<p>The first reliable evidence of storytelling we have comes from cave art. The oldest cave art comes from the Blombos Cave in modern-day South Africa and is around 75,000 years old.</p>

<p>Archaeologists working there have also found articles that might date back to sometime between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago (Henshilwood et al., 2009; St. Fleur, 2018). The earliest examples are mostly geometrical shapes, dots, or even handprints. Still, with time, the images started changing to more closely represent the world that surrounded the people of that time. Examples such as the Altamira or Tito Bustillo caves in Spain date back at least 30,000 years and show pictures of animals (UNESCO, n.d.). Their meanings are still being debated, but it is safe to assume that storytelling was an essential component of their creation because some of these animals appear to move in the flicking light of a fire.</p>

<h2>Storytelling and Social Complexity</h2>
<p>Once human groups grew in complexity, from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to more organized societies, the available evidence of storytelling also changed. Below, you will learn more about early examples of stories depicted in art and literature.</p>

<p>As societies became more and more complex, stories continued changing with the times.</p>

<p>Think of The Decameron or The Canterbury Tales. They portray the world as Boccaccio and Chaucer knew it while reflecting on how people should behave.</p>

<p>Yet, until the improvement of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2023), tales were limited to the closest audiences. The new press allowed printers and authors to spread their stories and other knowledge far and wide. It gave rise to mass media for a broad audience. Later, TV and film took these stories even further, making them known worldwide regardless of language or literacy level.</p>

<h2>The Digital Era</h2>
<p>Once we reached the digital era, storytelling adapted to its new medium: the Internet. Today, storytelling can be found on social media, YouTube, and blogs. An example is X (formerly Twitter) threads that go viral because they tell a story well. Some, like Dear David or Zola, have been so successful that they are being adapted into feature films. Others have become media sensations or have made their way into everyday life.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above, our brains are wired to be affected by storytelling so it is a tool often used in marketing and sales. Later in this course, you will learn about storytelling strategies and see how these have been used in advertising campaigns of different kinds.</p>
