            <h2>Part 4: Goals, Characters, and Narrative Theory</h2>
            <p>Understanding that every organization possesses a diverse array of characters to employ in digital storytelling is invaluable. However, it prompts the question: How should these characters be cast, and what facets of their narratives should take center stage? The embodiment of these stories will draw on a range of complex skills, from emotional intelligence to market know-how.</p>

<p>Thankfully, narrative theory serves as a guiding light in this selection process. This umbrella theory brings together a wide array of narrative frameworks that have proven to be effective across cultures and throughout time.</p>

<p>Outlined below are the seven fundamental plotlines. It's important to note that these are not rigid rules but rather inclinations. Narrative types can be modified, re-envisioned, or even interwoven with other topics. While these structures might appear somewhat intricate for the often-concise formats of digital storytelling, the primary objective is to consider the values and mood that each framework highlights. By doing this, we can craft focused stories that will resonate most strongly with your audience.</p>

<p>Later in the course, we will introduce a more streamlined framework, better suited for the brevity of digital storytelling, as seen in advertisements or social media posts.</p>

<p>In addition to the theoretical foundation, we've included some examples of commercials that draw upon these narrative structures to illustrate their practical application.</p>

<h2>Overcoming the Monster</h2>

<p>In this narrative type, the hero faces a formidable antagonist or threat that endangers their world. They embark on a journey to confront and ultimately defeat this antagonist, often requiring courage, strength, and wit. The story focuses on the protagonist's struggle to overcome this looming danger, which poses a threat not only to them but to the broader community.</p>

<p>A particularly innovative use of this framework is “Bear 71,” the strange dystopian story of a real-life grizzly. In this case, the narrator uses the radio collar data from the bear to tell the bear’s own story. As the story emerges, we see her trying to survive in a complex environment in which the worlds of humans and animals have collided. See the video hereLinks to an external site..</p>

<h2>Rags to Riches</h2>

<p>This narrative follows the protagonist's journey from hardship to success or wealth. After attaining their desires, they encounter setbacks or losses. However, through resilience and personal growth, they regain what they had lost, leading to a satisfying and meaningful transformation.</p>

<p>In the following video, the “rags to riches” structure is used to poignantly tell the story of the Spanish Christmas lottery, an event in which entire groups typically buy a single lottery number together. In this case, one co-worker didn’t participate in his company’s purchase and risked being excluded from the winnings.</p>

<p><em>(Burnett, 2014)</em></p>

<h2>The Quest</h2>

<p>The quest narrative revolves around the protagonist's pursuit of a specific goal, whether it's a treasure, a destination, or something else of value. Along the way, they face various trials and obstacles, testing their determination and resourcefulness. The narrative is about the hero's odyssey and how they evolve as they overcome challenges to attain their goal.</p>

<p>A shockingly simple version of this was published by McDonald’s. Many would still qualify this as storytelling even though it is a single Tweet. The experience of getting to the drive-through and being so overwhelmed that you can’t make a decision is so universal that it rang true for hundreds of thousands of people. It may not be an epic quest, but a quest, nonetheless.</p>

<p><em>(Ciarci, 2023)</em></p>

<h2>Voyage and Return</h2>

<p>In this storyline, the protagonist embarks on a journey to an unfamiliar, often fantastical place. They face challenges that help them grow along the way. Upon their return, they bring these newfound lessons and experiences back to their ordinary life, contributing to their personal growth and a deeper understanding of their world.</p>

<p>The following video shows a clever use of “voyage and return.” Here, the digital storyteller capitalizes on a common impulse: “How can I sit doing mundane office work while the world is teetering on the brink of collapse?” Instead of lecturing us about the well-known environmental dangers we face, they have used humor to draw us in and present an innovative solution.</p>

<p><em>(Rainforest Alliance, 2013)</em></p>

<h2>Comedy</h2>

<p>Comedy narratives are characterized by humor and lighthearted events. The protagonist encounters a series of amusing, confusing, or even absurd situations, leading to a joyful and satisfying resolution. These stories often explore the lighter side of life, celebrating the human ability to find humor in everyday situations.</p>

<p>The next video shows this well.</p>

<p><em>(Adds Nation, 2019)</em></p>

<h2>Tragedy</h2>

<p>Tragedy narratives follow the protagonist's downfall due to a central character flaw or a tragic mistake they make. The story leads to a catastrophic outcome, typically marked by suffering, loss, or even death. Tragedies serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the consequences of human flaws and decisions.</p>

<p>The following commercial highlights a more subtle but equally impactful form of tragedy as we see Santa Claus questioning the value he has brought to the world. Please note that on YouTube the language can be changed to Spanish or Portuguese (click on the gear icon, subtitles, auto translate, and your choice of language).</p>

<p><em>(NAMI, 2019)</em></p>

<h2>Rebirth</h2>

<p>In this narrative, the protagonist undergoes a profound transformation, often triggered by a life-changing event or self-discovery. They evolve into a better, more enlightened person as a result. The rebirth story emphasizes personal growth, redemption, and the opportunity for characters to redeem themselves and find a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

<p><em>(Nowadays, 2022)</em></p>

<p>Below we see a Thai commercial that captured the world’s attention. Although the advertisement is for a phone company, the digital storyteller has focused more abstractly on the concept of communication. Here we see a dramatic scenario in which multiple rebirths happen as the weak become powerful, and the devastated become victorious.</p>

<p><em>(TrueG5, 2013)</em></p>

<p>Before leaving this section, it is important to note that although we live in an age dominated by video, other media can be extraordinarily effective as well. In the following example, produced by the Greater Chicago Food Depository, an organization that gives food to those in need, the core message is conveyed in fewer than 10 words and a single black-and-white photo, yet the story seems both vivid and universal.</p>


<p><em>(Be Specialist, n.d.)</em></p>

<p>Another elegant yet evocative example is from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Here, they show how the stunning and complex process of evolution is threatened by the human desire for something as mundane as a fur jacket.</p>

<p><em>(MacLeod, 2008)</em></p>

<p>And finally, a brief social media post manages to capture the lives of four employees at Etsy who have found the courage to come out and present as themselves. The image and text clearly define the values of the organization and invite their community to like and comment. Stories such as this can reach the public in a way that mission statements and HR policies can’t.</p>

<p><em>(Lifeatetsy, 2019)</em></p>

<p>We will now shift perspectives from what the digital storyteller is creating to what their true objective is. What information do we need to communicate? What action do we need to inspire? What mood do we need to strike? In focusing more on the end than the means, we will hone our ability to select the most effective narrative structure listed above.</p>
