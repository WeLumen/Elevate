            <h2>Part 3: Storytelling Frameworks and Techniques</h2>
            <p>Stories need a hero, i.e., someone who the audience can aspire to be like. The hero in your story can be a celebrity or an influencer, but often they can be a relatable everyday person. In these cases, the character reminds the audience of what is possible and serves as an example of what the audience can also strive for and achieve. On the other hand, digital storytelling can also display the opposite of what the audience should do and provides an example that people are capable of making different, better choices. In these situations, the character is someone who the audience does not want to be like.</p>

<p>Whatever type of character you choose to incorporate into your story, it is important to provide them with a path to follow and a framework for telling the story. A framework helps the audience better understand the story, make predictions, and set a structure for where the story is going to go.</p>

<p>The function of a digital storytelling framework is not only to give us a step-by-step model of how a story should be structured, but also to allow the storyteller to deviate from the framework in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>A helpful framework that can be used in digital storytelling is a three-part formula:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Challenge</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Choice</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Outcome</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>(Narrative Arts, 2023)</p>

<p>Below, we will review each part of the framework.</p>


<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>The challenge is the conflict that is present in the story and helps create interest in it and allows for the audience to feel invested in what is to unfold. The challenge creates a situation in which the character is after something that is difficult to obtain. A compelling story creates a challenge that provides characters with a drive and objective that keeps them moving forward and makes the characters relatable to the audience.</p>

<h2>Choice</h2>

<p>Choice in a story helps reveal the values of those in the story. One common plotline is the quest, which presents the character with a choice of what is familiar to them versus making a choice that is a risk because the path is unknown. If a character chooses the unknown path, it can reveal that they are brave and adventurous. Providing character choices shows that characters have agency, and that the audience can also have agency over their choices and empowers them to take action.</p>

<p>The choices your characters make should reflect the values your company or organization holds.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>The outcome is the result of the choice made by the characters. The outcome provides the reward or payoff that the character and audience is looking for. It is important to base the outcome of your story on the goal you want to achieve in telling it. Most times you want the outcome to be positive and inspire action, change, and motivation within the audience.</p>

<p>The challenge, choice, outcome formula can help keep storytelling short, concise, and engaging. This is important since in the digital age we often contend with character and word counts. Moreover, consumers of digital media now more than ever are looking for content that is easy to consume in a short amount of time. Therefore, it is important to be concise while still reaching the emotional payoff and delivering the message you want your audience to receive.</p>

<h2>You can make your story more concise by:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Choosing and following a digital storytelling framework.</li>
  <li>Practicing telling your story and trying to make the story shorter each time you practice.</li>
  <li>Using language that is important to the story and not adding additional and unnecessary language that does not move the story forward.</li>
</ul>
