            <h2>Part 2: Creating a Digital Story With KPIs</h2>
            <p>The head/heart/hands/hooks framework is an excellent way to focus your ideas for your campaign. This human-centered approach can hone your storytelling; however, we don't want to stop there. Digital storytelling also has a very technical component which we need to incorporate. In the video below, we will look at how we can apply real-world KPIs (key performance indicators) to these very emotive messages.</p>

  <p>Thinking holistically is key to the people you want to reach and the change you want to drive. Whatever your objectives may be, adding KPIs is important. Remember KPIs are the metrics that you follow to see if you are on the right track or not. They allow you to understand how well goals are being met.</p>

  <p>Remember that there are dozens of KPIs to choose from. Deciding on which metric to use might require thought or creativity, but it can be done. Here are a few KPIs to consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Web traffic</li>
    <li>Time spent on site</li>
    <li>Likes, shares, and comments</li>
    <li>DMs</li>
    <li>CTR (click through rate)</li>
    <li>Social media mentions</li>
    <li>Refferal traffic</li>
    <li>Sales</li>
    <li>Video views or duration</li>
    <li>Customer feedback reviews</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If your goal is to change the feelings and beliefs around your brand, tagging KPIs that track sentiment is a must. If your objective is about relationships, then the number of followers, comments, interactions and even how many sales calls were booked is a way to measure KPIs.</p>

  <h3>Remember</h3>
  <p>The head/heart/hands/hooks framework will clarify your campaign objectives and determine what elements should be measured.</p>

  <h2>Digital Storytelling Technique: User-Generated Content</h2>

  <p>New exciting ways of telling stories are emerging. Nothing puts the audience at the center of the story more than actually telling their stories. One technique that allows people to share their narratives and experiences is user-generated content (UGC). User-generated content is when brands or businesses encourage their customers, clients, or followers to create and share content related to their products or services. This can include reviews, testimonials, photos, videos, and more.</p>

  <p>Here are some techniques on how to effectively leverage UGC.</p>

  <h3>1. Determine your audience and objectives</h3>
  <p>Don’t underestimate this step. This will act as the basis on which the entire project rests. Take time to consider this question carefully doing whatever research in necessary.</p>

  <h3>2. Create a theme and messaging</h3>
  <p>Themes and messages are very specific to each organization and campaign. The theme should embody the essence of the creator's intention and the message should express that intention in concise, memorable language. This is the classic combination that has served marketers for years; however, the modern world offers a powerful, innovative twist: the hashtag.</p>

  <p>The hashtag can take a message that we would have ingested passively and transform it into one that we express actively. Moreover, it can take a single static slogan and allows it to be altered and expressed in different ways.</p>

  <p>Below is an example from L'Oreal. The cosmetics giant had the intention of deepening the conversation around women's issues. Not content to relay their message as mere ad copy, they transformed it into the hashtag #Worthsaying, allowing women to contribute ideas that they found especially powerful to fuel important conversations.</p>

  <p>(Morris, n.d.)</p>

  <h3>3. Encourage participation</h3>
  <p>Actively encouraging your customers and followers to share their stories is fundamental. Incentivizing participation through doing drawings, hosting contests, or featureing submissions on the homepage, are all very effective. Without participation, there won't be user-generated content to work with. Make sure to use various marketing channels to promote this, such as social media, email, and your website.</p>

  <h3>4. Highlight user stories</h3>
  <p>Share and celebrate UGC on your own social media channels and website. Showcase customer reviews, photos, videos, and stories that demonstrate how your product or service benefits them.</p>

  <h3>5. Maintain authenticity</h3>
  <p>User-generated content is most effective when it's genuine and unfiltered. Authenticity is key, so avoid over-editing or altering the content shared by users. It should reflect their real stories and experiences.</p>

  <h3>6. Tell their stories</h3>
  <p>Go beyond simple reposts of user content. Consider crafting narratives or stories around the experiences of your customers. This can be done through blog posts, case studies, or video testimonials.</p>

  <h3>7. Showcase diversity</h3>
  <p>Highlight a variety of user stories and experiences. This can demonstrate the broad appeal of your product or service and make more people feel represented and encouraged to participate.</p>

  <p>User-generated content serves as a powerful digital storytelling tool. Through UGC, potential customers gain insights into how your products or services can make a real difference in their lives. It's an effective means to infuse a human touch into your brand, business, or organization and fosters personal connections with your audience.</p>

  <p>In 2018, CLIF, an American company that makes energy food and drink, filmed a team of bikers on an eight-day biking journey from San Francisco, California to Alaska. Instead of highlighting the CLIF products, the video features footage of the bikers’ journey, as well as challenges and accomplishments of the group. CLIF bar chose to tell the bikers’ story since their audience values the outdoors and being active. CLIF’s choice to highlight and promote stories that reflect their brand’s value helped connect their customers with the product and also attract new customers.</p>

  <p>Below is the video of user-generated content for CLIF.</p>

  <p>User-generated content serves as a powerful digital storytelling tool. It offers social proof and fosters trust, enabling your customers to become advocates for your business, brand, or organization. Through UGC, potential customers gain insights into how your products or services can make a real difference in their lives and allows them to share their personal stories. It's an effective means to infuse a human touch into your marketing strategy and fosters personal connections with your audience.</p>
