            <h2>Part 1: Storytelling: Objectives</h2>
            <p>As mentioned, in this section, we will establish clear objectives, enabling us to express the previously mentioned timeless narrative structures in the concise formats of modern digital storytelling. To achieve this, we will be following the framework devised by Miriam Brosseau. Her approach is rooted in a holistic consideration of her audience, and she has crafted the "Head, Heart, Hands, and Hooks" system to gauge how storytelling will resonate with the viewer.</p>

            <p>(Brosseau, 2023)</p>
        
            <h2>Head</h2>
            <p>In this context, "head" signifies the information that the storyteller intends to communicate. They must have a clear awareness of the facts they wish to validate or convey, whether it's a sale, a product recall, the introduction of a new version, or an urgent political call to action.</p>
        
            <p>When done well, this freshly delivered information can be exceptionally memorable, potentially even achieving viral status. At the very least, it should be effective in directing action ("I must have the new iPhone!") or igniting conversations ("Have you heard that the new iPhone is AI-enabled?").</p>
        
            <h2>Heart</h2>
            <p>The term "heart" pertains to the emotion you aim to evoke in the viewer. It's about whether you want to bring forth tears, laughter, or instill an entirely new mood. This aspect is especially significant because it's well known that the majority of purchases are driven by emotions.</p>
        
            <h2>Hands</h2>
            <p>Brosseau introduced "hands" to signify the specific actions we intend for the viewer to take. Is it about encouraging them to make a purchase, recycle, contribute financially, or renew their membership?</p>
        
            <p>A striking example of this can be observed on social media, where individuals are often presented with challenges. These challenges frequently serve as catalysts, motivating people to engage in actions such as sharing information or posting filter-free photos.</p>
        
            <h2>Hooks</h2>
            <p>Lastly, we have "hooks," representing the connections we aim to establish with the viewer. This can also be viewed as the relationship between the client and the vendor. This is a remarkably significant aspect, as individuals tend to form strong bonds with the brands they buy. Just envision the challenge of persuading a devoted Coke drinker to switch to Pepsi—most would likely decline the offer.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond tribal affiliation, the relationships that brands foster with customers can take other forms as well. A particular children’s snack or pet food may become part of our emotional language, showing that we care enough to give the best.</p>
        
            <p>While brand loyalty is undeniably powerful, we must also consider the opposite: the potential for boycotts and backlashes when a brand is perceived as betraying its core demographic.</p>
        
            <p>This system is a simple way to remember the four pillars of digital storytelling. It is easy to bombard with information, inundate with emotion, overwhelm with demands, or simply forget that that the key is developing a positive long-term relationship. By using this method, we are constantly reminded to strive for balance and communicate with the whole person.</p>
