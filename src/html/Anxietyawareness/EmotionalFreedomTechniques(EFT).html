            <p>Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), are a relatively new discovery but use age-old energy understanding and knowledge to release blockages within the energy system. These blockages are thought to be the cause of emotional disturbance and can limit us emotionally and physically in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>The Emotional Freedom Techniques are used to release these blockages by 'tapping' with the fingertips, rather than with needles, the ends of energy meridians situated under the skin. Whilst tapping you say specific affirmative statements, and these are used to rewire your neural pathways and eliminate negative emotional charges.</p>

<p>According to Chinese medicine, your energy, your life force, referred to as 'Chi' flows along known paths (the meridians) with access points known as acupoints. If the flow of Chi is disrupted, then ill health can result.</p>

<p>By touching your meridian points while reciting specific affirmative statements, tapping sparks change within you on a cellular level by rewiring your neural pathways and eliminating your negative emotional charges.</p>

<h3>Tapping Routine</h3>

<p>In order to gain the many benefits from EFT, it’s important to understand the basic tapping routine.</p>

<p><strong>Affirmations</strong> are what you say during the tapping routine. We call them set up phrases and reminder phrases, but they are all affirmations.</p>

<p>By tapping through the negative thoughts, we aim to release these, let go of the feelings and replace them with a positive view of what we have been feeling.</p>

<h3>So how do we find out what to tap on?</h3>

<p>There are no set lists of things to say. Have confidence in yourself and just follow your instinct.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1. What emotions do you feel you would like to talk about and deal with today?</strong><br> I’m so worried about my son at school that it’s affecting my sleep.</li>
  <li><strong>2. What is it that you are worried about?</strong><br> I’m worried that he’s being picked on.</li>
  <li><strong>3. What is happening that is making you feel so worried?</strong><br> He’s coming home with marks and says it someone hurting him at playtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is called the <strong>Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS)</strong>.</p>

<p>Think about your MPI and then think about how it makes you feel. What level of distress does it bring up? 0 being no distress at all.</p>

<p><strong>Example set-up statement:</strong> “Even though I feel worried about my son, I deeply and completely accept myself.”</p>

<p>You tap on the Karate Chop point or the Sore Spot point and repeat the phrase 3 times.</p>

<h3>Main 8 Point Tapping Sequence</h3>

<p>Throughout this sequence you tap each point around 7 times whilst saying reminder phrases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feeling worried</li>
  <li>Worried about my son</li>
  <li>This awful feeling</li>
  <li>Not able to sleep</li>
  <li>This worry controlling me</li>
  <li>Wanting it to stop</li>
  <li>Feeling worried</li>
</ul>

<p>So, remember, it doesn’t matter in the reminder phrases what exactly you are saying, just go with where you are and how you are feeling.</p>

<h3>Hand Sequence</h3>

<p>The hand sequence can be added on at the end of the basic sequence if more tapping is required. Use the karate chop point too if you like.</p>

<p>This has covered the basic tapping routine. We've also included a tapping routine document that you can download in the resources section of this lesson.</p>

<p>It’s an amazing tool that can be used wherever and whenever. Whatever issue comes to mind, just remember to tap on it!</p>

<p>If you'd like to go further in-depth here about EFT, I'd highly recommend looking online at <strong>‘The Tapping Solution’</strong> or any videos by <strong>Jessica and Nick Ortner</strong>.</p>

<h3>Tapping</h3>

<p>Give it a try! Tap each point around 7 times, saying phrases that relate to an issue that is causing anxiety.</p>

<p>You may say: <strong>“Even though I feel anxious over my position at work, I deeply and completely accept myself.”</strong></p>
