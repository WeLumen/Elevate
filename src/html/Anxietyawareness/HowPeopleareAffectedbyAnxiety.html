   How People are Affected by Anxiety</h2>
    <p>This lesson will explore the ways that different people are affected by anxiety, as well as the physical, behavioural, and psychological impacts it can bring.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety</strong> can bring on many challenging feelings that can make it difficult to deal with. One of the feelings people experience alongside anxiety, particularly if it triggers a panic attack, is fear. This can be because of the confusion and not understanding what is happening at that moment in time, the symptoms of anxiety feeling like a serious health problem, or the inability to control what is happening to them. This fear can then trigger even more anxiety, making symptoms worse and the feel of panic even stronger.</p>

<p>Fear can be a contributing factor that increases the likelihood of future problems with anxiety. For those who are particularly fearful of panic attacks, they will often remind themselves of them, which can cause further anxiety and stress, bringing on future panic attacks. Finding ways to calm the feeling of fear during periods of anxiety or panic attacks can work to reduce the frequency of this happening as well as the severity of the attacks.</p>

<h3>Ways that Anxiety can Affect Behaviour</h3>
<p>Those with anxiety can feel very alone, with symptoms and anxiety attacks making it difficult to go about their life as they used to. As a result, many people isolate themselves and withdraw from social interaction.</p>

<p>This is referred to as ‘avoidant behaviour’, where individuals avoid certain situations or change their behaviour, so they do not face common triggers of their anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>Common behaviours include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Staying at home</li>
    <li>Being less social, avoiding people and places</li>
    <li>Choosing to visit places at quiet times</li>
    <li>Refusing to leave the house alone</li>
    <li>Leaving without warning anybody</li>
    <li>Turning to ‘coping mechanisms’ such as taking medication, drinking alcohol, smoking, pre-planning how to leave a situation, or holding a specific object</li>
</ul>

<p>These behaviours will often bring a sense of calm and control to people with anxiety, meaning they will repeat the same behaviours. While this may bring a feeling of relief in the short-term, it does not work in the long-term as anxiety does not go away without being acknowledged or working on it.</p>

<p>While there are no scientific studies that support this point, there is a common belief that anxiety and the associated behaviours can be picked up by children from their parents, through learning.</p>

<p>This means that people with anxiety often display specific symptoms and behaviours. Children witness these and often pick up on them, doing the same things subconsciously, whether it’s in their childhood or later in life. Children often see parents as role models and learn many of their coping mechanisms and behaviours from them, explaining why anxiety can run in families.</p>

<h3>Ways that Anxiety can Affect Someone Physically</h3>
<p>The ways in which people can be affected physically by anxiety can vary greatly, depending on how severe their symptoms are and how long they have been happening. Anxiety and stress often come hand in hand, meaning they share similar symptoms, as well as the physical effects they bring.</p>

<p>Continuous anxiety can reduce the immune system’s ability to function well, increasing the levels of cortisol in the body, which means the individual is more likely to become ill or catch infections. Anxiety can also affect the digestive system, stopping its regular functioning. Intestines are often impacted by chronic anxiety, resulting in heartburn, bloating and even problems with bowel control.</p>

<p>The brain is also greatly impacted by anxiety, causing difficulties for its cognitive functions and memory. Other symptoms can include difficulties focusing or paying attention for long periods of time, as both of these functions require the use of areas of the brain that are also affected by anxiety.</p>

<p>As anxiety increases blood pressure, this can increase individuals’ likelihood of developing heart problems, as the arteries are narrowed. Constricting blood flow around the body means that people are a lot more likely to have a heart attack or stroke if left untreated.</p>

<p>Many people who are likely to experience anxiety also say they feel tension, which can be shown in their muscles. People who are anxious often have knots in their muscles, as a result of tension on a regular basis. Tension in the body can also cause headaches, achy shoulders, neck pain and even a migraine.</p>

<p>Lastly, the adrenal system releases large amounts of cortisol in reaction to anxiety and stress, impacting other systems in the body, as well as the immune system. A spike in cortisol production prompts the liver to increase glucose production as a result of the fight or flight response being activated. Most people are able to reabsorb this excess of glucose, however for those with diabetes, or at risk of developing diabetes, this can cause further health implications.</p>

<h3>Ways that Anxiety can Affect Someone Psychologically</h3>
<p>There are many negative psychological effects of anxiety, with clear links to depression and stress. When people feel unable to cope with anxiety, they often isolate and withdraw themselves, which can trigger and worsen depression. From this point, it can be difficult to break out of harmful routines. Without social interaction and support, feelings of anxiety can deepen as there is no one around to talk through what we are thinking and help us to control our spiralling thoughts.</p>

<p>Another condition that can occur through anxiety is fatigue. Due to the mind and body’s continuous over activity, people can be tense and struggle to relax and de-stress. This can cause noticeable fatigue, with people feeling tired on a regular basis. This can also mean people are less productive and want to do even less, often making symptoms worse.</p>

<p>Anxiety is closely linked to many panic disorders, which often result in changes to the lifestyles that people previously led. The combination of fatigue, lack of social activities, low energy levels and panic disorders can impact people’s lives enormously and cause significant psychological challenges.</p>

<h3>Wider Factors Affected by Anxiety</h3>
<p><strong>Anxiety</strong> obviously affects the person who is experiencing it, and it can affect them in many ways. There are also wider factors that can be affected when someone is experiencing anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>These can include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Friends and family becoming informal carers</li>
    <li>Relationship factors</li>
    <li>Work factors</li>
    <li>Financial factors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Friends and Family Becoming Informal Carers</h3>
<p>Those with severe anxiety can experience other conditions, for example, agoraphobia. These challenges can result in friends or family being required to help, or even becoming informal carers.</p>

<p>Informal carers are people that assist those who are unable to cope with day-to-day routines and activities. Needless to say, this places a lot of responsibility on the carer, as they often are unable to continue with their life as they used to. Many informal carers also are given no option but to help, which can regularly complicate relationships, damage work-life balances and place a lot of pressure on the carer.</p>

<p>This means that a friend or family member becoming an informal carer can often cause further anxiety for everybody involved.</p>

<h3>Relationship Factors</h3>
<p>Anxiety can cause isolation but can also have a large impact on those around the person experiencing anxiety. A common side effect of anxiety is relationship issues as it places an increasing strain on those around the individual with anxiety. Whether the person does not want to spend time with others, doesn’t want to go out in public or regularly struggles to be positive, it can be difficult for others to cope with.</p>

<p>The symptoms of anxiety regularly put pressure on others, meaning arguments and disconnections unfortunately take place. This can be a result of the other person not understanding somebody’s anxiety or the way they act, or even disagreements with how it can be helped.</p>

<p>People with anxiety tend to rely on their partners or friends for support. This means that these people may cook, clean, do shopping trips and much more for the person with anxiety as they are able to complete these tasks more easily. While many partners and friends are happy to do this, some may lack empathy as they cannot see physical symptoms and don’t understand why the person with anxiety cannot do these things for themselves. This can often begin a vicious cycle as the person with anxiety feels alone and unsupported as tension grows.</p>

<h3>Work Issues</h3>
<p>People who experience anxiety often have a high level of absenteeism from work or school, particularly if attending is seen as a cause of anxiety.</p>

<p>In 2014/15, there were nearly 10 million working days where people were absent as a result of stress-related issues (HSE, 2015). This clearly demonstrates the impact stress can have on somebody’s ability to go to work as normal. In cases where people still push themselves to go to work, their performance can often suffer due to their inability to concentrate and be productive. This poor performance can then lead to people paying attention to the situation, criticism from team members and in turn, more anxiety.</p>

<h3>Financial Factors</h3>
<p>This is linked to work factors above. When we are struggling to cope with work, to focus on our careers, to actually do the job that we are in, then this can lead to financial problems, as we may not have as much money coming in as we had before. This in turn can lead to further anxiety and the added issues of money worries, mortgage payments, car payments etc, can make everything seem even worse.</p>

<p>Sometimes anxiety can actually lead to overspending as well, as some people use 'buying' as a way to make them feel better in that moment in time. The arrival of a new package creates a spark of hope, the idea that what they have bought is what they need to be able to feel better. This overspending, when it spirals out of control, can obviously lead to further anxiety when the realisation hits that they are further in debt.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>, there are many ways that Anxiety can affect behaviour and there are many wider factors that are affected by Anxiety. It is not all bad news, however! Anxiety is something that once recognised, it can be worked on and supported, so that normal life can resume and the feelings of being happy and content can be brought back!</p>

<p>Further on in the course we will discuss how we can support and overcome Anxiety and how it is an individual journey where we need to recognise what works for us and go with it!</p>
