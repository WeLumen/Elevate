        <section class="course-overview">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your course Mindset. This course is divided into 7 modules.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Self-Awareness</h2>
            <p>This module is an invitation to come home to yourself — to witness, with tenderness and curiosity, the layers of your inner world. Through gentle exploration, you’ll begin to understand who you are beneath the noise of external expectations and inherited beliefs.
            In these seven lessons, you’ll uncover the power of self-awareness as a foundation for conscious living. You’ll reflect on your core values, question the thoughts you think, and rediscover the quiet wisdom of your sense of self. With tools like journaling and daily reflections, this module offers a nurturing space for clarity, connection, and truth.
            
            Let this be the beginning of your return — to your voice, your essence, your presence. The Reclaimed Woman knows that awareness is the first step to liberation.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 2: Shadow Work</h2>
            <p>In this module, you’ll enter the sacred terrain of your inner shadows — not as a place to fear, but as a space of immense healing and transformation. Shadow work is the art of meeting what’s been hidden, unspoken, or shamed within us, with compassion and courage.
            You’ll be lovingly guided through journaling prompts, rituals, and somatic reflections to support your integration process. This is not about fixing what’s broken — it’s about reclaiming the parts of you that have been left in the dark.
            
            The Reclaimed Woman turns toward herself, even when it’s hard. This module helps you do just that — with reverence, softness, and soul.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 3: Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life</h2>
            <p>Your mind is a sacred storyteller. In this module, you’ll explore how to consciously shape the narratives that define your experience of life. With guidance from Dr. Sally Olewe-Richards, you’ll begin to shift limiting thoughts and anchor new, empowering beliefs that align with your truth.
            This is not about toxic positivity — it’s about conscious rewiring. About choosing thoughts that support your healing, your boundaries, and your becoming.
            
            Your thoughts shape your energy. Your energy shapes your life. Let’s begin there.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 4: Becoming More Resilient</h2>
            <p>In this module, you’ll be held in the wisdom of inner strength. With support from your coach and the powerful teachings of Tamika Brown, you’ll explore what it means to build nervous system resilience from a place of softness, not force.
            You’ll also gently explore your money mindset — how your past beliefs around worth and safety may have shaped your relationship with abundance.
            
            Resilience isn’t about pushing through. It’s about learning how to stay — with grace, with boundaries, and with rooted presence.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 5: Break Free from Limiting Beliefs</h2>
            <p>This module invites you to meet the subconscious patterns that have quietly shaped your life — and begin the journey of rewriting them. You’ll explore the hidden scripts that have kept you small, and learn how to shift them using journaling, somatic practices, and healing modalities like Theta Healing.
            This is a sacred unraveling — a shedding of old skins that no longer reflect who you truly are.
            
            It’s time to break free. Not by force, but through loving awareness, clarity, and aligned belief.</p>
            
            <h2>Module 6: Reframing Your Belief System</h2>
            <p>What if your beliefs were invitations — not definitions? In this module, you’ll explore how to consciously reframe the mental patterns you’ve inherited and internalized. With Alina, your Blooming Mind Coach, you’ll be guided through a series of transformational reflections and practices designed to help you soften into new truths.
            You’ll be supported with deep journaling workbooks and daily affirmation cards, crafted to root new beliefs into your heart, body, and mind.
            
            Your story is evolving — and you get to be the one who writes it, this time with compassion and power.</p>
