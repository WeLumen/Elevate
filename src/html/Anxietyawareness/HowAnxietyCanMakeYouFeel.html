   How Anxiety Can Make You Feel</h2>
    <p><strong>Anxiety</strong> is a wide term that can affect people in many different ways. There is no one feeling that everyone feels, it is personal, and it depends on levels of anxiety, an individual's stress tolerance, wider support networks etc as to how people react to the anxiety they are feeling.</p>

<p>For example, if people have support around them and have learnt ways to deal with their anxiety that work for them, then they will react differently to a situation than someone who has not developed coping mechanisms.</p>

<h2>So, what feelings can Anxiety cause?</h2>



<h3>Feeling of shock</h3>
<p>It can provoke a feeling of shock when people have periods of anxiety for the first time. It is also possible for people to have a feeling of anxiousness without an obvious reason, due to difficult experiences in the past and memories being repressed.</p>

<p>When the feeling of anxiety develops with no known stressor at the time, it can be incredibly difficult to cope with. As an example, if somebody has just avoided a car crash and goes into fight or flight mode, this is understandable, and they can understand what has triggered their feelings. In comparison, somebody who is relaxing in bed and suddenly feels an overwhelming sense of panic may be a lot more alarmed by this as they do not understand the cause. The shock of unexpected anxiety and feelings of panic can make it difficult for people to know how to react, particularly if this is not a regular occurrence.</p>

<h3>Feeling of embarrassment</h3>
<p>People often avoid social situations when they feel anxious for fear of embarrassment around others as they struggle to cope with their anxiety.</p>

<p>Many people who experience anxiety are also perfectionists, wanting things to always appear ‘normal’ to others, therefore bringing on a fear of looking weak or like they are struggling. They may also worry that others will be embarrassed by their actions if they have a panic attack or period of anxiety. An example of this would be a parent who wants their children to be happy, therefore being afraid to tell them about their anxiety, or scared for it to happen when they are in public. This could be out of embarrassment or worrying that their children will be embarrassed by the situation.</p>

<h3>Feeling alone</h3>
<p>Anxiety can make people feel very alone and isolated as they see themselves feeling and reacting differently to those around them. People who suffer from anxiety can feel quite embarrassed, as we have discussed above, and this can lead them to staying away from social situations so as not to cause themselves stress. This, however, can make anxiety worse as by staying away from social interaction, the mind will continue to think the worst and there is no one around to allay those fears. People can then feel disappointed in themselves or that they have let people down because they have not attended - it is a vicious circle of regret, and one that is not comfortable being alone in.</p>

<h3>A feeling of needing to escape</h3>
<p>When people experience perceived or real life-threatening situations, their body is flooded with adrenaline, triggering a fight or flight response. As a result of this, many people’s immediate reaction is wanting to run. Feeling the need to run and wanting to escape is however, not often useful in many situations such as during a work meeting or family meal. When people then try to repress the feeling of needing to run away, it can often spark a panic attack by triggering even more anxiety as the adrenaline cannot be dealt with through the likes of running or leaving the situation.</p>

<h3>Feeling a loss of control</h3>
<p>A common symptom of anxiety is the feeling of a loss of control, being detached from reality and unable to control their reactions or the things that happen.</p>

<p>The feeling of losing control can see individuals shout or panic in public, drawing attention to themselves; another reason many people with anxiety choose not to enter social situations when they can feel any anxiety, is fear of panicking in public.</p>

<p>Feeling as though you have lost control is a difficult experience, often making people feel like they have lost their mind. As a result, many people are concerned that doctors of mental health practitioners will look to force treatment upon them or see them as an unfit parent, preventing them from seeking the help they need.</p>

<h3>Feeling worthless</h3>
<p>Anxiety can make people feel that they have no worth, that their opinions do not matter and that they are not worthy of people’s time etc. This can prevent people from seeking out support as they feel that they are not worth it and there is no reason why anyone would want to help them. It can be really lonely for anyone who suffers from anxiety as they can become isolated in their own thoughts and their perception of others' thoughts.</p>

<h3>Feeling irritable and tense</h3>
<p>Those with anxiety that occurs on a regular or long-term basis can often feel irritable and tense due to the way they feel. They are often nervous of experiencing anxiety as well as their actions when they have a panic attack, so the sense of fear and dread can make it difficult to feel relaxed.</p>

<p>This can mean people lose their temper at things that typically wouldn’t cause as much anger. Family and friends often find this hard to cope with as they cannot understand why people are so irritable, particularly if it’s very different to how they acted before suffering from anxiety. In addition to this, feeling tense continuously can cause physical aches and pains, for example, having stomach and digestion problems or headaches.</p>

<h3>Feeling sad</h3>
<p>Anxiety can cause an overwhelming sense of sadness as people get weighed down with their thoughts and nothing seems to make them happy. They can become upset quite easily as often things seem far worse than they are. For example, a person who suffers from anxiety may become upset when something goes wrong, even if whatever has happened is not particularly a problem. If they are feeling anxious then they will see things as worse than they perhaps are and therefore not be able to see any solutions to the problem that they have found themselves in. This can cause people to react to a situation quite differently than you thought.</p>

<p><strong>Anxiety is a personal journey</strong> and one that individuals need to work through themselves - there is no one size fits all. When we discuss working through this themselves, this does not mean that you cannot seek advice and support - these things are essential, but what it does mean is that it is down to the individual to make those steps that are right for them.</p>

<p>So, the first step is recognising how anxiety is making them feel and then they can work on coping mechanisms to support themselves in those situations that cause anxiety.</p>

<h3><strong>In this lesson we have looked at:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Feelings</strong> – The feelings that anxiety can cause.</p>
<p><strong>Personal journey</strong> – How anxiety is a personal journey and that there is no right or wrong solution.</p>
