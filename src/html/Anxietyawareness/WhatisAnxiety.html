    <span class="bar"></span> What is Anxiety?</h2>
            <p>This lesson will outline what anxiety is and the ways in which it can cause panic attacks. It will then explore the various causes of anxiety, including life experience causes and physical causes, as well as biological and personal causes. The lesson will then go on to explain the most common symptoms of panic attacks.</p>
          <h2>What do we Mean by Anxiety?</h2>
          <p>Anxiety can be difficult for people to manage, resulting in many adjustments to the ways people live, their health and even their personality in some cases. This does, however, differ from stress. While stress can be difficult to diagnose and give an exact definition of, anxiety has a definition that can be used to determine whether or not somebody suffers from it.</p>
          <p>The definition of anxiety is “an uncomfortable feeling of nervousness or worry about something that is happening or might happen in the future.”</p>
           
            <p>Prolonged and long-term anxiety is the type of anxiety that is experienced most often by people. This can also result in other conditions arising, meaning it is important for those with anxiety to have it diagnosed through their symptoms and begin treating it as soon as possible. By understanding when people are experiencing periods of anxiety, they are also able to seek support, making it a lot easier to overcome and cope with.</p>
       
       <h2>Possible Causes of Anxiety</h2>
       <p>There are many possible causes of anxiety, and these can differ from person to person. They can loosely be grouped into the following areas:</p>
       <ul><li>Life experience causes</li>
    <li>Physical causes</li>
    <li>Biological causes</li>
    <li>Personal causes</li></ul>

    <p>Let's look at each one in a little more detail:</p>
    <h3><strong>Life experience causes:</strong></h3>
    <p>Experiences in people’s lives can lead to the development of anxiety issues. Our past experiences present themselves in many different ways and one of these can be anxiety. </p>
    <p>Past experiences can include:</p>  
    <p><strong>Childhood trauma – </strong>Experiencing neglect, physical abuse or mental abuse as a child can contribute greatly to experiencing anxiety, whether it is at a young age or develops at a later date. This is typically the result of having significant moments of distress take place in childhood. People who experience this are often surprised when their actions begin to become somewhat controlled by these memories, sometimes years or decades after the event actually occurred. This cause of anxiety can therefore be attributed to childhood trauma but can be difficult to identify by the person involved, due to repression.</p>
      <p><strong>Adult trauma – </strong>This can be a result of large life changes, such as the loss of a loved one or divorce, resulting in anxiety. While it may not always be caused by neglect or abuse, adults often become so caught up in a life-changing event that they are unable to see the impact it is having on them. Once things settle again, anxiety can often be present as the adult adjusts to the new life changes and experiences emotions that they may have not expected to.</p>   
      <p><strong>Regret – </strong>This can be very difficult to deal with and can cause people to feel anxious. We are all looking at other people’s paths and the decisions they have made, and sometimes this can cause us regret that we did not choose similar pathways. The more we regret our choices the more anxious we can feel.</p>  
      <p><strong>Unemployment – </strong>Not having a job to go to is a common cause of anxiety. Whether somebody has lost their job, is unable to get a job or cannot work for other reasons, this life change can often result in a feeling of not knowing how to cope. First, there is the short-term stress caused by losing a job, followed by other factors such as debt and a lack of social life that are more long-term. These can impact other areas of individuals’ lives, also resulting in anxiety.

</p>  
      <p><strong>Repression – </strong>The process of removing a memory or experience from a person’s conscious mind so it does not cause pain. Repressed thoughts can become troublesome in later life and appear again.</p>   
      <p><strong>Guilt – </strong>The feeling of guilt for past decisions or something that we have done/not done can cause anxiety. This 'past looking' thinking can lead to regret and causes people to mull over times when they have felt guilt. </p> 
      <p><strong>Relationships – </strong>A relationship can easily cause anxiety, particularly when people have their confidence knocked and feel a loss of control over what happens. This can range from people who have a controlling partner who does now allow them to make decisions for themselves, or somebody who regularly damages their self-esteem. This is not only found in romantic relationships, with friendships also playing a large role. As an example, being regularly let down by friends or left out of a friendship group can lead to a feeling of helplessness and worry. These knocks to the individual’s confidence and self-belief are common contributing factors to anxiety.</p> 

      <h3><strong>Physical causes:</strong></h3>
      <p>Physical causes can also result in the appearance of anxiety. These can include:</p>
      <p><strong>Chronic pain – </strong>Anxiety can increase when a person suffers with chronic pain, due to anticipation of the pain and knowing how they will feel. When people know that they are going to feel pain and they start to feel it coming on, then this can cause anxiety about what is to come.</p> 
      <p><strong>Drugs – </strong>The use of drugs can result in anxiety, whether they are prescription or illegal drugs. This is due to the effect they have on the body. Sometimes, people who have begun to take a new kind of prescription drug may experience anxiety, due to the changes it has on the balance of brain chemistry and the chemicals it produces. It’s important to carefully pay attention to any side effects of medication, particularly if they are used to treat mental health issues, due to the implications of their side effects. Illegal drugs can also cause a wide range of challenges. Often used as a result of struggles in life or to counteract a difficulty, illegal drugs can begin a cycle that causes anxiety, leaving the increase of dosage being seen as a common solution, however this exacerbates the problem and makes it worse once the drug has left the body. Side effects of drugs that can cause anxiety include difficulty in controlling mood swings, a feeling of panic and even paranoia. </p> 
      <p><strong>Being overweight – </strong>Feeling that they are different or feeling out of place can cause people to feel anxiety. Being overweight can cause people to be limited in things that they can do and this can cause feelings of guilt and regret.</p>  
      <p><strong>Unstable blood sugar – </strong>The effects of blood sugar instability include feeling dizzy, excessive sweating and shaking. These can easily cause anxiety due to the symptoms often being identical to that of a panic attack. Those with panic and anxiety issues may not know that they have a physical condition such as diabetes or hypoglycaemia as they may attribute their symptoms to their anxiety instead of being diagnosed with unhealthy levels of blood sugar.</p>
      <p><strong>Physical differences – </strong>These can range from what someone looks like, to disabilities, to just feeling out of place and different. When someone is not comfortable with their appearance and their body, this can cause anxiety in social situations and can often lead to a person becoming isolated.</p>
      <h3><strong>Biological causes:</strong></h3>
      <p>Biological causes have the potential to trigger anxiety. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Genetics – </strong>Many believe that genetics are linked to countless illnesses and issues, both physical and mental. Many illnesses have proven links to genetic causes; however this is not proven in all cases. Research has demonstrated that this could be inherited; for example, an individual is more likely to have anxiety if their parents have anxiety issues as well. However, it has also been argued that this could be a result of the symptoms and feelings of anxiety being learnt from parents, as opposed to being genetically predisposed to having it.</p> 
       <p><strong>Mind management – </strong>The way we are programmed to control and work with our minds can determine if we will suffer from anxiety. Some of us are predisposed to be able to work with our thoughts and control our emotions and these people are less likely to suffer from anxiety. This may be down to learnt behaviour from parents and how we have been brought up, rather than our genetic make-up. For example, if we are taught how to use our thoughts and control our minds positively, from a young age, then we are more likely to be able to deal with life as an adult.</p> 
    <h3><strong>Personal causes:</strong></h3>
    <p>Personality plays a large role in the likelihood of experiencing anxiety. This is influenced particularly by a person's thinking style. Having positive thought patterns means people are less likely to feel overwhelmed by challenging situations. Alternatively, those with negative thinking patterns are more likely to have a pessimistic outlook which can lead to the feeling of being overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation.</p>
          <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Reactions to Anxiety
  </h2>
  <p>One particularly scary reaction to anxiety is having a panic attack. Panic attacks are given the following definition:</p>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      “a sudden period of severe anxiety in which your heart beats fast, you have trouble breathing and you feel as if something very bad is going to happen.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>A quarter of people in the UK experience some kind of mental health issue every year and the likelihood of many of these people having either chronic (long-term) or acute (short-term) panic attacks is high.</p>>
    <p>Panic attacks are very frightening for those who experience them as the symptoms can make it feel as though they are unable to breathe, often making the symptoms worse as they are very similar to that of a heart attack.</p>
    <p>People often experience one or many of the following symptoms when having a panic attack:</p>
    <ul><li>Fast heartbeat</li>
    <li>Sweating</li>
    <li>Shaking</li>
    <li>Ringing sound in ears</li>
    <li>Feeling detached from what’s happening</li>
    <li>Feeling dizzy</li>
    <li>The sense of impending doom or death</li>
    <li>Chest pain</li>
    <li>Feeling numb</li>
    <li>The feel of choking</li>
    <li>Fear</li>
    <li>Crying or screaming they cannot stop</li></ul>

    <p>The reason for panic attack symptoms is that the body enters its ‘fight or flight’ mode. This is a reaction that was more useful many generations back, warning the body and preparing it in the presence of real or perceived danger by filling it with adrenaline.</p>
    <p>One of the factors that makes panic attacks so alarming for those having them is that they often happen without warning, or even while individuals are sleeping, occurring suddenly. </p>
    <p>While panic attacks are frightening for those who have them, they are not fatal and the panic does not last forever, despite how it may feel at the time. Typically, a panic attack lasts for between a couple of seconds and around 30 minutes. The reason they stop is because anxiety levels do reach a peak and then begin to calm down again, returning to more normal levels as symptoms reduce. Remembering this is incredibly important during a panic attack as it can prevent the symptoms becoming worse and can give you peace of mind in what is otherwise an incredibly scary time. </p>
    
    
    <p><strong>In this lesson we have looked at:</strong></p> 
    
    <p><strong>Panic attacks – </strong>Severe, quick-onset periods of anxiety that can increase an individual's heart rate, bring on a feeling of impending doom and make it difficult to breathe.</p>
    <p><strong>Biological causes – </strong>Studies have shown that those who have parents with anxiety are more likely to have anxiety issues as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Childhood trauma – </strong>Having periods of great stress in childhood, for example incidents of neglect or abuse, can be a major contributing factor to somebody developing anxiety issues shortly after or later in their life.</p>
    <p><strong>Drug use – </strong>Prescription and illegal drug usage can result in anxiety; due to the way the body reacts to them.</p>
    <p><strong>Thinking style – </strong>A person’s thinking style plays a large part in whether somebody is likely to experience anxiety, based on their personality and general outlook.</p>
