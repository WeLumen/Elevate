            <h2 class="section-title">Feeling Stressed</h2>
            <p>The experience of stress can vary for each individual, as well as the length of time it goes on for. This unit will look at the physical, mental, and emotional impacts of short-term and long-term stress, as well as the symptoms that accompany this.</p>

<h2>What Does Stress Feel Like?</h2>
<p>Stress is incredibly challenging for anybody going through it, regardless of whether it is short-term or long-term. There are many physical, mental, and emotional effects that it has, impacting people’s entire lives.</p>
<p>The emotional impact of stress can be incredibly difficult to deal with, regardless of whether they have ever been stressed before or not.</p>

<h3>Common Feelings During Stress</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Feeling worthless</li>
  <li>Fear</li>
  <li>Anxiousness</li>
  <li>Loneliness</li>
  <li>Isolation</li>
  <li>Dread</li>
  <li>Feeling unable to cope or overwhelmed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can stress make you feel dread and feel alone?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! People going through stress often say they have the feeling of dread, yet they do not know what it is that they are dreading, or what is causing it.</p>
<p>This is linked to anxiety and panic as the feeling of unexplained dread can cause anxiousness and make a person panic, creating a chain of events that can be both frightening and difficult to control.</p>
<p>One of these is the feeling of loneliness or that nobody is able to relate with what they are going through.</p>

<h3>Isolation and Depression</h3>
<p>When people feel isolated, they are unable to speak to others easily about their challenges. By not seeking help, stress can lead to other mental health problems, such as depression if it is ignored or untreated.</p>

<h2>Stress and Fear</h2>
<p>Both fear and anxiety are experienced by those who are going through periods of stress; however, they can be caused by different things for different people.</p>
<p>The combination of anxiety, stress and fear is one that is incredibly difficult to deal with, impacting an individual’s ability to go about day-to-day tasks.</p>
<p>Some people going through stress may experience panic at the same time, caused by adrenaline activating fight or flight mode.</p>

<h3>Stress and Self-Esteem</h3>
<p><strong>So, does stress affect our self-esteem?</strong> Yes!</p>
<p>Stress can damage self-esteem, making people feel unable to deal with life's demands and feel like they have failed.</p>
<p>This can lead to people feeling worthless, afraid to ask for help, or feeling undeserving of support.</p>

<h3>Panic Attacks</h3>
<p>Many people experiencing stress also experience panic attacks. Panic attacks feel very similar to a heart attack, which increases panic even more.</p>

<h3>Symptoms of Panic Attacks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Chest pain</li>
  <li>Trembling and shaking</li>
  <li>Hyperventilation</li>
  <li>Sweating</li>
  <li>Feeling detached from reality</li>
  <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
  <li>Choking</li>
  <li>Feeling dizzy</li>
  <li>Numb or tingling sensation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stress and Feeling Overwhelmed</h2>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed is common in stress. This feeling is not only about the original stressor, but also the consequences it brings.</p>
<p>When people feel overwhelmed, they usually don’t know where to begin solving their problems.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The breakdown of a marriage may cause stress, anxiety, and the responsibility of raising children alone. This can lead to emotional shutdown and paralysis.</p>

<h3>Consequences of Feeling Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>Overwhelmed individuals may not make plans, stay organized, or take steps to make life better.</p>

<h2>Ways to Manage Stress</h2>
<p>We all need to find what works best for us. Try new things and discover what makes you feel good.</p>

<h3>Volunteering to Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Volunteer work can help with self-esteem and confidence. It can also offer distraction, social opportunities, and a sense of value and purpose.</p>

<h3>Using Diet to Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Eating well can help individuals feel more energetic, alert, and able to deal with stress. A healthy diet includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proteins</li>
  <li>Carbohydrates</li>
  <li>Fats</li>
  <li>Vitamins</li>
  <li>Minerals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Hobbies to Manage Stress</h3>
<p>Hobbies provide joy and fulfillment. They offer focus, pride, and relaxation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Playing football</li>
  <li>Jogging</li>
  <li>Playing the guitar</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
  <li>Painting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Support Online</h3>
<p>Online forums and communities offer support from people who understand stress and anxiety. This helps reduce isolation and provides a space to share feelings.</p>

<h3>Health Professionals and Group Support</h3>
<p>A GP can give medical advice and refer to therapists or prescribe medication. Health centres may also offer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walk-in appointments</li>
  <li>Gym memberships</li>
  <li>Pilates and yoga sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Community Groups</h3>
<p>Community support groups allow people to share feelings, find empathy, and realize they are not alone.</p>
