            <p>This lesson will look into Mindfulness and how mindful thinking can help to relieve anxiety.</p>

<p>We all want to be emotionally well, and the link between emotional and physical wellness is becoming more and more recognised and focused on. Stress is not just too much work, feeling overwhelmed, too busy. It is anything that triggers the <strong>AMYGDALA</strong>, our threat response in part of the Limbic, primordial brain.</p>

<p>This constant onslaught on our senses of emotions such as panic, worry, anxiety, anger, and fear also triggers the Amygdala and the hormonal and energetic cascade begins. We are then in Fight or Flight and our bodies switch off from basic responses like digestion and healing and preventative maintenance.</p>

<p>However, the constant ‘having to fix things’ eventually causes the body to become ill.</p>

<p><strong>As Dr. Lissa Rankin points out:</strong></p>

<p>Our bodies will ONLY heal when the parasympathetic, relaxation response occurs. If we remain in the fight or flight stress response, many of the other subconscious responses switch off and our physiology suffers. We become physically sick.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a mind body thing.</strong></p>

<p>Mindfulness and the calming of the amygdala can help us move away from the stress response towards these heart qualities.</p>

<h3>What is Mindfulness?</h3>

<p>Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we are doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what is going on around us. We are mindful.</p>

<p>Dr Siegal and other Mindfulness Practitioners have recognised that it takes 90 seconds to hold an emotion if we don’t feed it. You feed emotions by giving them thoughts. By not feeding the emotion, you don’t embrace that emotion, you don’t accept it. You have the ability to stop an emotion – it only takes 90 seconds.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts of Mindfulness</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Being fully present:</strong> You are aware of all that is going on around you and what you are experiencing in the present moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on the present moment:</strong> You bring your thoughts back to the present when they veer into past or future worries.</li>
  <li><strong>Open to experience:</strong> You welcome new thoughts and feelings with curiosity, knowing they will pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-judgmental:</strong> You do not judge your feelings and can extend this to other people and situations.</li>
  <li><strong>Able to connect:</strong> You feel grateful, connect positively with others, and understand differing behaviours.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepting:</strong> You accept reality as it is and tolerate challenges, acting mindfully even when protesting or advocating.</li>
  <li><strong>Attachment Free:</strong> You are not ruled by attachment, recognizing life flows and you can adapt and grow.</li>
  <li><strong>Compassionate:</strong> You show empathy to yourself and others, understanding the roots of behaviour without judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>By recognising these concepts, we can begin to introduce mindfulness into our lives. Bringing mindfulness into daily routines, like walks or short meditations, helps shift from autopilot to awareness.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Mindfulness</h3>

<p>Mindfulness helps relieve stress, anxiety, and depression, but its core aim is to train the mind and raise awareness of ‘what is.’</p>

<p><strong>As Eckhart Tolle says:</strong> “In today’s rush, we all think too much, seek too much, want too much, and forget about the joy of just being.”</p>

<p>There are many physical, mental, and emotional benefits of mindfulness, even if not yet fully recognised in medical fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental strengthening and present-moment happiness</li>
  <li>Calming of the mind</li>
  <li>Control of emotions</li>
  <li>Increased motivation and self-understanding</li>
  <li>Increased energy and improved digestion</li>
  <li>Relaxed tension and lowered blood pressure</li>
  <li>Improved circulation and heart health</li>
  <li>Strengthened coping mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p>Mindfulness training strengthens our minds and detaches us from negative patterns, enabling emotional regulation and mental clarity.</p>

  <li><strong>What is Mindfulness</strong> – Being mindful and staying in the present can work to reduce and relieve feelings of anxiety.</li>
  <li><strong>The Benefits of Mindfulness</strong> – There are many physical, mental, and emotional benefits of mindfulness that are commonly held, even if they are still not yet fully recognised in medical fields.</li>
</ul>
