            <h2 class="section-title">Anxiety Triggers</h2>
            <p>This lesson will explain the ways in which anxiety can be triggered, also exploring the ways people may then attempt to avoid these triggers. Common triggers can include visiting crowded areas, facing their fears, being in unfamiliar situations or traumatic experiences.</p>

<p><strong>These can be split into 3 categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Places</li>
  <li>Phobias and fears</li>
  <li>Situations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Places</h3>

<h3>Places associated with memories</h3>
<p>People often avoid facing situations that they associate with a difficult or traumatic memory. As an example, this could mean that a person may avoid visiting a shopping centre where they had their belongings stolen, or in some cases, they may even avoid going anywhere with the friends they were with at the time due to association.</p>

<p>In the case of particularly stressful events, people can develop post-traumatic stress disorder, often abbreviated to PTSD. This disorder means that people relive the traumatic moments and memories repeatedly, often triggered by specific scents, views, and locations.</p>

<p>Anxiety can worsen until people are then reluctant or scared to go outside, meaning they have agoraphobia; a condition that drastically impacts a person’s entire way of living.</p>

<p>This can mean people require a carer to help them do necessary daily tasks, or to help pick up food as they are unable to go outside due to their inability to cope. When people do not seek help for agoraphobia, their condition can worsen, leading them to not leave their home for weeks, months, or even years at a time.</p>

<h3>Places that are new</h3>
<p>Some people’s anxiety is linked to experiencing new and unfamiliar events. If people are unsure of how a day or event may unfold, they can be cautious and incredibly anxious before and during the event. Often, this means they will cancel out of a fear that they will struggle, embarrass themselves by attending, or have a panic attack around people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, avoiding these situations can worsen the condition as it causes a person to believe that escaping/avoidance is the only way to relax, meaning the anxiety remains and they do not challenge themselves to confront their anxiety.</p>

<h3>Places that are crowded</h3>
<p>Crowded places are a known fear for many people with anxiety, triggering their fight or flight response and resulting in them feeling a desperate need to escape the situation. People who experience this often avoid crowded places or go shopping at quieter times to avoid this occurring, which can impact their social lives and make them feel isolated.</p>

<p>As an example, many people who are afraid of crowded places may avoid going to concerts, shopping centres, cinemas, and large events.</p>

<h3>Places that are deserted</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is the opposite of crowded places that can cause anxiety. Sometimes it can be places that are deserted or feel 'closed' that can bring up feelings of anxiety. Some people prefer the buzz of others around and this can make them feel safe, whereas quiet and deserted places can instil fear. Most people who suffer from anxiety will be more affected by a crowded place than a deserted place, but it is worth noting that we are all different and have our own likes and dislikes and our own ideas about which places make us feel relaxed and at ease.</p>

<h3>Public forms of transport</h3>
<p>The avoidance of public transport is common in those with agoraphobia, or the fear of crowded places. Those with anxiety find themselves expecting something bad to happen, having a negative outlook on possibilities.</p>

<p>This is called ‘catastrophising’ and is the process of always expecting the worst outcome in any scenario, predicting that challenges will happen and then something will go wrong. Often, this occurs on transport, giving the feeling of needing to get off a bus or train before something goes wrong, however when this is not possible as it is moving, it can cause great anxiety, distress, and panic. In this situation, those with anxiety will also be afraid of a panic attack occurring, and will seek ways to escape the situation they are in - which often means, getting off the mode of transport.</p>

<h3>Phobias or Fears</h3>
<p>While different people face anxiety in different situations, there are some situations that cause many people anxiety.</p>

<p>One of these is a phobia, or when someone is being forced to face their fears. As an example, someone who is afraid of heights may experience anxiety when they are high up, and this is due to their underlying phobia. This anxiety can range from mild, making a person more consciously aware of what they are doing, all the way to severe anxiety, which may mean that a person cannot go through with the activity/action that they were going to do.</p>

<h3>Situations</h3>

<h3>Meeting new people</h3>
<p>Meeting new people or friendship groups can cause anxiety for those who worry about how others may perceive them. This can range in severity, from general nervousness when meeting new people, to somebody having severe anxiety that completely prevents them from meeting with new people in the first place.</p>

<p>This can also have a knock-on effect, as people who are afraid of meeting new people may then be afraid to visit public places in case they have to speak to somebody or embarrass themselves. If untreated, this can then mean that the individual avoids leaving their home wherever possible due to their fear of new people.</p>

<h3>New career</h3>
<p>Starting a new job can be an extremely stressful and nerve-wracking time, but for anyone who suffers with anxiety then this can be magnified. Sometimes the feelings of anxiety can actually stop people from changing their jobs or careers, even when they know that their jobs or careers may be causing the anxiety in the first place. The fear of moving jobs may just be too much.</p>

<h3>Moving house</h3>
<p>As above, the thought of moving and the change and disruption that this could bring, can just be too much for some people.</p>

<h3>Any new situations</h3>
<p>Any situation that is new and has not been experienced before can cause anxiety. As discussed earlier, it can cause anxiety building up before the event and even cause that person to cancel their plans and stay home – or wherever they feel safe.</p>

  <li><strong>Places</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Phobias and fears</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Situations</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>And how these can be triggers for Anxiety and feelings of anxiousness.</p>
