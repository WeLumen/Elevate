            <h2>Part 1 : People Pleasing</h2>

            <p>I’m so glad you’re here. This gentle and nourishing mini-course was lovingly created to support you in understanding and healing the deep patterns of people pleasing. If you’ve ever found yourself putting others first—at the cost of your own emotional well-being—know that you are not alone, and you are deeply seen here.</p> <p>In this first part of our journey together, we’ll gently explore the roots of people-pleasing behaviors. You’ll be guided through reflections and practices to reconnect with your emotional truth, validate your inner experience, and begin softening the habits that no longer serve you.</p> <p>My name is Libby Triolo. I’m a licensed therapist, a women’s empowerment and mindset guide—and someone who deeply understands the people-pleasing path, because I walked it for many years myself. It’s from this place of compassion and lived experience that I now support other women in reclaiming their voice, their space, and their joy.</p> <p>This space is for you—to shed expectations, return to your essence, and step into a life that feels whole and aligned with your heart’s truth. Let’s begin, together.</p> <h2>Our First Practice: Awareness & Self-Honoring</h2> <p>We'll begin by gently noticing how people-pleasing patterns may be showing up in your life. You’ll need a journal, some paper, or a digital space where you can reflect deeply and honestly.</p> <p>Please number your page from 1 to 30. As I read a series of statements, place a gentle check mark beside the ones that resonate with you—no judgment, just loving awareness. These statements are invitations to witness yourself more clearly, with kindness.</p> <h2>Reflection & Integration</h2> <p>Once you complete this exercise, take a few soft breaths and spend some time journaling your reflections:</p> <ul> <li>Which statements surprised you?</li> <li>Which ones feel the most present or tender in your life right now?</li> <li>In which relationships or areas of life do these patterns show up most strongly—your romantic relationship, work, family, or friendships?</li> <li>Are there people or dynamics that feel especially hard to navigate without falling into people-pleasing?</li> </ul> <p>Next, explore the gentle but important question: <strong>How are these patterns impacting your emotional, physical, and relational well-being?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Do you feel unseen, disconnected, or even resentful in some relationships?</li> <li>Is your nervous system carrying too much—stress, anxiety, exhaustion, or tension?</li> <li>Are your needs, dreams, or self-care being left behind?</li> </ul> <p>Allow these reflections to be a mirror—not of shame, but of clarity. This is how we begin to understand your “why.” Why is it time to release these patterns? What do you long for instead? What would it feel like to live guided by your own desires, your own values, your own inner compass?</p> <p>This is a sacred step on your journey home to yourself. So take your time. Be gentle. Be honest. You are safe here. You are worthy of healing, and you are allowed to grow in your own rhythm.</p> <p>When you're ready, I’ll meet you in the next part of our journey together.</p>
