        <section class="course-overview"><h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your course  Relationships & Communication. This course is divided into 6 modules.</p>
            <h2>Module 1: Relationships & Communication</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Relationships & Communication—a transformative journey into the heart of how you connect, communicate, and create emotional intimacy.</p>

                <p>This course was designed to help you build conscious, healthy, and fulfilling relationships by first deepening your relationship with yourself. Through reflective practices, emotional awareness, and empowering tools, you’ll learn how to express your truth with confidence, set clear boundaries, and nurture connections that feel aligned and safe.</p>
                
                <p>Whether you’re healing past wounds, seeking clarity in your current relationships, or simply wanting to grow into a more grounded and empowered version of yourself—this space is for you.</p> 
                
                <p>Let this be the beginning of more authentic love, stronger self-worth, and deeply nourishing communication.</p>
            <h2>Module 2: Love Languages</h2>
            <p>Understanding how you give and receive love is one of the most powerful tools for building deeper, more fulfilling relationships. The concept of Love Languages, introduced by Dr. Gary Chapman, reveals that we all express and interpret love in different ways—and knowing your primary love language can transform the way you connect with others. Whether it’s through words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, physical touch, or receiving gifts, discovering your love language helps you communicate your needs clearly and recognize how others show care in their own unique ways. In this guide, we’ll explore each love language in depth and help you reflect on your own preferences, so you can build stronger emotional bonds in both romantic and non-romantic relationships.</p>

            <h2>Module 3: Attachment Styles</h2>
            <p>Our attachment style shapes the way we connect, communicate, and create intimacy in our relationships. Formed early in life and influenced by our caregivers, these patterns continue to impact how we experience love, trust, and emotional safety well into adulthood. In Module 3: Attachment Styles, you’ll explore the core types of attachment—secure, anxious-preoccupied, avoidant-dismissive, and fearful-avoidant—and begin to recognize your own relational patterns. Through guided reflection, journaling practices, and supportive affirmations, you’ll build greater emotional awareness and learn how to navigate relationships with more clarity, compassion, and confidence. Whether you’re seeking to heal from past experiences or deepen your current connections, understanding your attachment style is a powerful step toward emotional freedom and healthier relationships.</p>

            <h2>Module 4: Boundaries</h2>
            <p>Setting boundaries is not about building walls—it’s about creating healthy space for self-respect, clarity, and emotional safety. Boundaries define what is acceptable and what isn’t in our relationships, helping us honor our own needs while respecting the needs of others. Without them, we risk burnout, resentment, and disconnection. This journey into boundaries will help you understand their true purpose, explore their emotional and relational benefits, and learn how to set them with confidence and compassion. Whether you're navigating personal relationships, professional environments, or inner conflict, boundaries are essential tools for maintaining balance, protecting your energy, and fostering mutual respect. Through this content and the accompanying Boundaries Ebook, you’ll also gain insights into conflict resolution, learning how to hold your ground without shutting others out. Boundaries are not a rejection—they are an act of self-love.</p>

            <h2>Module 5: Break Free from People Pleasing</h2>
            <p>People pleasing often stems from a deep desire to feel accepted, loved, or safe—but over time, it can lead to exhaustion, resentment, and a disconnection from your true self. In Module 5: Break Free from People Pleasing, you’ll begin the powerful process of reclaiming your voice, your boundaries, and your inner truth. This module invites you to gently explore the roots of people pleasing, become aware of how it shows up in your body and behavior, and begin shifting into a more authentic way of being. Through somatic practices like body scanning, reflective journal prompts, and connecting with your deeper “why,” you’ll gain tools to break the cycle and step into self-leadership with clarity and compassion. This isn’t about becoming selfish—it’s about honoring your needs without guilt and learning to show up for others without abandoning yourself.</p>

            <h2>Module 6: Your Guide To Assertive Communication</h2>
            <p>Assertive communication is the key to expressing your truth with clarity, confidence, and respect—both for yourself and for others. It allows you to speak up without aggression, set boundaries without guilt, and navigate conversations with greater ease and integrity. In Module 6: Your Guide to Assertive Communication, you’ll learn how to break free from patterns of silence, passive-aggressiveness, or over-explaining, and begin communicating from a grounded, empowered place. Through a combination of practical guidance and deep self-reflection, this module includes a series of journal prompts and workbooks designed to help you integrate assertive communication into your daily life. Each lesson offers space to explore your voice, uncover limiting beliefs, and practice new ways of speaking your truth. This is more than a skill—it’s a form of self-respect in action.</p>
