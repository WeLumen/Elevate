            <h2>6 Steps to Free Yourself from Toxic Relationship Patterns and Reclaim Your Power</h2>
            <p>Welcome, beautiful soul, to this transformative <strong>Thrive Masterclass</strong>! I am truly honored to guide you through six powerful steps that will help you release fears, insecurities, and limiting beliefs that may be keeping you stuck in unwanted, painful patterns. This is your space to explore, heal, and align with the abundant, love-filled life your heart desires.</p>

            <p>Together, we will dive deep into the unseen, unconscious influences that may be shaping your experiences in ways you haven’t even realized. And most importantly, I will walk you through what truly works—not just in theory, but in real, lasting transformation.</p>
        
            <p>If you’ve found yourself in cycles of toxic relationships, unfulfilling love, or repeating patterns in different areas of your life, this journey is for you. Perhaps you’ve noticed a <strong>push-pull dynamic</strong> in your relationships, and maybe even with money—an <strong>anxious attachment</strong> that keeps you feeling unsafe and uncertain. These steps will empower you to create shifts, not only in love but in all aspects of your life.</p>
        
            <h2>Meet Your Guide: Marilia Gabriela</h2>
            <p>Originally from São Paulo, Brazil, I spent over 20 years in the UK building a successful career in property management and hospitality. After a life-changing divorce, I embarked on a journey of transformation that led me to my true purpose: guiding others in their healing. Today, I am a certified Hypnotherapist, Inner Child Healing Practitioner, NLP Master Coach, and EFT Practitioner. I support emotional healing and personal growth through empathy, empowerment, and holistic tools. I also lead empowerment and spiritual retreats, helping individuals reconnect with their inner strength and become their best selves.</p>

            <h2>This Journey is for You If...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You feel stuck in frustration and are repeating painful cycles.</li>
                <li>You’re struggling with self-esteem and self-worth.</li>
                <li>You long to feel safe, seen, and loved unconditionally.</li>
                <li>You desire a life that feels aligned and fulfilling.</li>
                <li>You’re ready to heal relationships—with others and yourself.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Whether it’s in relationships, career, health, or personal growth, these steps will guide you to <strong>healing</strong>, <strong>confidence</strong>, and the <strong>joy</strong> that comes from true inner transformation.</p>
        
            <p>If any of this resonates with you, know that <strong>you are not alone</strong>. I have worked with many women of women who have faced similar struggles, and I want you to know that <strong>change is possible</strong>. <strong>Healing is possible</strong>. <strong>Thriving is possible</strong>. And it starts from within.</p>

            <p>This is not about quick fixes, pretending to be someone you’re not, or following superficial strategies to attract the “right” partner, job, or lifestyle. This is about doing the <strong>deep inner work</strong> so that you naturally radiate the energy of <strong>unconditional love</strong>, <strong>self-acceptance</strong>, and <strong>empowerment</strong>.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, we will uncover the old <strong>childhood programming</strong> that may be influencing your self-talk, your relationships, and your ability to receive the love and abundance you truly deserve. Many of us unknowingly attract people and experiences that reflect our deepest insecurities. But once you bring <strong>awareness</strong> to these patterns, you gain the power to shift them.</p>

<p>This journey is about more than just survival—it’s about <strong>thriving</strong>. When you’ve been stuck in a toxic cycle, your nervous system may have been in survival mode for so long that joy, connection, and a sense of ease may feel foreign to you. But you are meant for more than just getting through the day. You are meant to live with <strong>peace</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong>, and <strong>passion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Patterns We Will Explore</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Attracting emotionally unavailable or narcissistic partners</li>
    <li>Feeling insecure, anxious, or fearful in relationships, finances, or personal growth</li>
    <li>Living in a state of hypervigilance, always waiting for the other shoe to drop</li>
    <li>People-pleasing and suppressing your true self to avoid rejection</li>
    <li>Seeking external validation instead of trusting your own worth</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these resonate, I want you to know that <strong>awareness is the first step toward change</strong>. Many women stay stuck in these cycles because they believe the problem is external, when in reality, the true power lies within.</p>

<p>Healing begins when we stop looking for validation outside of ourselves and start cultivating <strong>deep self-love</strong>, <strong>strong boundaries</strong>, and an <strong>unshakable sense of self-worth</strong>. It is about moving beyond survival mode and into a state of <strong>thriving</strong>—where you feel secure, connected, and empowered to create the life you desire.</p>

<h2>Embodiment Is the Key</h2>
<p>This is not just about learning new information; it’s about <strong>embodiment</strong>. It’s about integrating these practices into your daily life so that change becomes second nature. Healing is a journey, and I am here to walk alongside you as you step into your power, reclaim your joy, and cultivate a life filled with love and abundance.</p>

<p><strong>Are you ready to break the cycle and step into the radiant, thriving version of yourself?</strong> Let’s begin.</p>

<h2>My Turning Point</h2>
<p>My turning point came when everything around me began to fall apart. I realized I was in a toxic relationship with someone who constantly triggered deep fears in me — especially my fear of abandonment. Arguments would erupt often, and each one sent shockwaves through my body. I felt like I had to fix everything to keep the peace, to prevent things from spiraling even further out of control.</p>

<p>But in doing so, I abandoned myself.</p>

<p>Instead of acknowledging my own emotions, I focused entirely on calming my partner — who would scream, shout, and make it nearly impossible to reason with him. My body began to go into a state of shock. I couldn’t breathe. I started having panic attacks. Sleep became elusive. I’d lie awake night after night, feeling restless and on edge. It was like my body was vibrating with unprocessed trauma rising to the surface.</p>

<h2>That was the moment I had to ask myself:</h2>
<p>Why am I in a relationship that makes me feel constantly unsafe, constantly on high alert?</p>

<p>My nervous system was breaking down. My body was telling me the truth I was too afraid to say out loud — that this relationship was not just emotionally unhealthy, it was harming me on a physical and psychological level.</p>

<p>So I started the journey inward. I began studying trauma, hypnotherapy, EFT — anything that could help me understand why I stayed, why I felt responsible for someone else’s chaos. Because despite not being the one causing the damage, I was always the one trying to repair it. I tried to communicate, to work through things, to meet in the middle — but the rules were always changing. And I was stuck in a cycle of self-blame, constantly trying to be “better” to keep him happy.</p>

<p>Over time, I started to unravel emotionally. Regulating my feelings became harder. I felt uneasy just being in his presence. Arguments became unbearable, and his go-to tactic of stonewalling became his way of punishing me — icing me out whenever I “upset” him.</p>

<p><strong>That’s when I finally understood:</strong></p>
<p>This person is not safe for my nervous system.</p>

<p>But what’s even more fascinating is that this stored trauma isn’t just ours. <strong>It’s inherited</strong>, passed down through generations. That’s why the way I work is deeply focused on clearing not just our personal pain, but also the <strong>ancestral and generational patterns</strong> that no longer serve us. So that we don’t pass them on. So that our daughters don’t carry what isn’t theirs to bear.</p>

<h2>Creating a Sanctuary</h2>
<p>Fast forward to today — I’m healing.
  That chapter is behind me now. It’s been over two months since he moved out, and in his absence, I’ve been reclaiming my life piece by piece.</p>

  <p>I’m not rushing into anything new.
    Right now, my greatest priority is me — creating a sanctuary where I feel safe, grounded, and at peace.</p>
    <p>This is my space for healing.</p>
      <ul><li>A space to breathe.</li>
      <li>To feel.</li>
      <li>To rebuild.</li></ul>
      <p>I’m no longer trying to survive chaos — I’m learning how to thrive in calm.</p>

      <p>I remember the moment I broke free from the trauma bond — it was the moment I realized I needed God.
        I was on my knees, crying my eyes out, completely exhausted — emotionally, physically, spiritually. And I asked God, from the depths of my soul, to help me let go. To help me break free from something I knew was destroying me, but couldn’t seem to walk away from on my own.
        </p>

        <p>And just one week after that prayer, the relationship ended.
          This time, for real.
          </p>

          <p>We had gone back and forth so many times before — breaking up, then getting back together, clinging to the hope that things would change. But that final moment felt different. It was a divine release. A sense of closure I hadn’t felt before.</p>

          <p>That’s when I began to understand something deeper:
            This relationship wasn’t just toxic — it was a mirror, replaying the wounds of my childhood. My nervous system wasn’t only reacting to him — it was reacting to unhealed parts of me. I was living out the pain I had buried, the abandonment I never acknowledged, the chaos I grew up with and learned to normalize.</p>

            <p>My body was keeping score of the trauma I had never fully processed.
              And this relationship was the trigger that brought it all to the surface.</p>

              <p>As a Brazilian woman, I also carried ancestral pain — generational trauma rooted in slavery, colonization, and a culture deeply shaped by dysfunction and survival. These wounds weren’t just mine — they were passed down. And they lived in my body, in my beliefs, in the way I navigated love and worth.</p>

              <p>I was carrying pain that didn’t start with me — but healing it is where it ends.</p>

              <h2>Breaking the Cycle</h2>

<p><strong>Since then, I’ve immersed myself in learning</strong> — course after course, certification after certification. Not just for the sake of knowledge, but because I made a vow to myself: <strong>this ends with me</strong>. I was determined not to pass these wounds forward. I refused to keep reliving the same painful experiences simply because I hadn’t taken the time to heal.</p>

<p>When you stop and truly look at your generational patterns, you begin to see. You don’t have to say it out loud — just sit with it for a moment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dysfunctional relationships</li>
  <li>Financial struggle</li>
  <li>Chronic illness</li>
  <li>Emotional disconnection</li>
</ul>

<p>We often accept these patterns as <strong>“just the way things are.”</strong> But that’s a lie we’ve been conditioned to believe. The truth is: <strong>you have the power to break the cycle</strong>.</p>

<h2>Living on My Own Terms</h2>

<p><strong>Today, I live on my own terms.</strong> I left my corporate job over five years ago when I realized that <strong>freedom is one of my deepest values</strong> — not just freedom from a job, but freedom from the past. Freedom from generational trauma. <strong>Freedom to create a new path</strong> — for myself, and for my children.</p>

<p>For years, I didn’t even know who I was. I was chasing success, building businesses, always striving… but I was disconnected from myself, from my truth. I was wearing a mask. And it wasn’t just the narcissists in my life who wore masks — <strong>I had one too</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The mask of the fixer</li>
  <li>The savior</li>
  <li>The one who held it all together</li>
  <li>The one who did it all</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But at what cost?</strong> At the cost of my own well-being. At the cost of my truth.</p>

<p>If you’re constantly giving, constantly showing up for everyone else — but no one is truly showing up for you — <strong>this is your wake-up call</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Power of Healing</h2>

<p><strong>Healing changes everything.</strong> It transforms your relationships, your health, your finances, your joy. But to reach that place, you have to be willing to face yourself.</p>

<p>And healing isn’t always soft. Sometimes your body will resist it — through exhaustion, migraines, even nausea. <strong>Your subconscious will do anything to keep you in what’s familiar</strong>… even if what’s familiar is pain.</p>

<p><strong>But push through.</strong> On the other side, there is beauty. There is freedom.</p>

<p>I invested in myself. I found teachers who guided me deeper than I ever imagined. I studied human attachment, relationship dynamics, subconscious patterns. I became a certified holistic coach, a hypnotherapist, an inner child practitioner.</p>

<h2>A Life-Changing Realization</h2>

<p>And along the way, I had a life-changing realization:</p>

<p><strong>Healing isn’t about blaming the toxic person, the narcissist, the emotionally unavailable partner.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It’s about changing you.</strong> Because when you shift… <strong>your entire reality begins to shift</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Shifts That Changed Everything</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Releasing Unworthiness</em> – The moment you let go of feeling “not enough,” you see yourself in a whole new light. Worthiness allows you to show up authentically, without needing a mask.</li>
  <li><em>Emotional Mastery</em> – I went from suppressing my emotions to honoring them. Your feminine power is in your emotions. Suppressing them only disconnects you from your intuition. The more you feel, the more you know.</li>
  <li><em>Embracing Feminine Flow</em> – I stopped forcing, striving, and operating in constant hustle mode. I learned to honor my feminine energy, my natural cycles, my intuition. Women aren’t meant to do everything like men. We are designed to flow, to create, to nurture in a way that aligns with our energy.</li>
  <li><em>Reconnecting with Source</em> – I went from feeling abandoned by God to feeling deeply held, deeply guided. And from this space, I learned to trust—trust myself, trust my intuition, trust that I am supported.</li>
  <li><em>Breaking Generational Patterns</em> – I became deeply aware of the unconscious cycles in my lineage. And I made a conscious choice to heal them, so they stop with me.</li>
</ul>

<p>The work isn’t always easy, but it is so worth it. When you heal, you don’t just change your life—you change the lives of the generations that come after you.</p>

<p>So if you’re here, reading this, know that you were meant to be. Your healing is already unfolding. And I’m honored to walk this path with you.</p>

<h3>This Is Your Time</h3>

<p>The work isn’t always easy, but it is <strong>so worth it</strong>. When you heal, you don’t just change your life—you change the lives of the generations that come after you.</p>

<p>So if you’re here, reading this, know that you were meant to be. <strong>Your healing is already unfolding</strong>. And I’m honored to walk this path with you.</p>

<p>Through my journey of earning numerous certifications and guiding so many incredible women—both one-on-one and in group settings—I’ve uncovered a deeply transformative process that supports <strong>healing, growth, and empowerment</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the foundational steps in this journey is <strong>reviewing your relationship blueprint</strong>. This applies to all relationships—romantic, familial, friendships, finances, business, and even the relationship with yourself.</p>

<p>Your <strong>subconscious blueprint</strong> was shaped long before you could even form conscious thoughts, beginning in the womb and continuing through early childhood, typically up to age seven or eight. During this time, your subconscious mind absorbed <strong>patterns, beliefs, and emotional experiences</strong> that now influence how you relate to others, money, love, and success.</p>

<h3>Womb Healing: Returning to the Root</h3>

<p>One of the most profound healing practices I use is <strong>womb healing</strong>—guiding women back through their timeline, even into the womb, to explore the beliefs and emotional imprints passed down from their mothers.</p>

<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>What traumas did my mother carry?</em></li>
  <li><em>How did those experiences shape my nervous system and subconscious programming?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding this allows us to begin <strong>unwinding and releasing patterns</strong> that no longer serve you.</p>

<h3>Why Childhood Matters</h3>

<p>Our early years are significant because, during this time, our brains function primarily in a <strong>theta wave state</strong>—a deeply receptive, almost hypnotic state where beliefs are imprinted with ease. If you've ever wondered why certain negative patterns keep repeating in your life, it often ties back to these <strong>deeply rooted subconscious programs</strong>.</p>

<p>Even emotionally charged experiences later in life can reinforce these pathways, creating a cycle that feels difficult to break.</p>

<h3>Reflect and Remember</h3>

<p>I invite you to reflect:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What societal and familial conditioning shaped your beliefs?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How did your childhood experiences influence your sense of worth, your relationships, your ability to receive love and abundance?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the relationships you were exposed to growing up. What was modeled for you?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Were love and affection freely expressed?</li>
  <li>Or did love feel conditional, painful, or even absent?</li>
</ul>

<p>For many women, early experiences taught them that <em>love must be earned through sacrifice</em>, that <em>relationships are power struggles</em>, or that they must <em>suppress their needs to maintain peace</em>.</p>

<p>If you grew up witnessing dysfunctional relationships, you might find yourself unconsciously repeating those dynamics or struggling to cultivate healthy, reciprocal connections.</p>

<p><strong>But here's the beautiful truth: awareness is the first step to change.</strong> Once you recognize these patterns, you can begin to shift them.</p>

<h3>Reconnecting with Your Inner Child</h3>

<p>As we move deeper into this healing process, we connect with the <strong>inner child</strong>—the part of you that learned to adapt, to please, to overgive, or to hide her true feelings.</p>

<p>We gently bring her back into the light with <strong>love, compassion, and understanding</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Healing is not about judgment;</strong> it’s about meeting yourself where you are with kindness. Many of us were not taught how to process emotions in a healthy way. We learned to suppress, avoid, or intellectualize them. But emotions are meant to be <strong>felt, expressed, and released</strong>—not stored within our bodies as tension, anxiety, or illness.</p>

<h3>Balancing Your Inner Masculine and Feminine</h3>

<p>This journey also involves learning to balance your <strong>inner masculine and feminine energies</strong>. As women—especially those who have had to be strong and independent—we may find ourselves in an <strong>overactive masculine state</strong>: always doing, providing, and achieving, yet struggling to receive, nurture, and rest.</p>

<p><strong>Healing means embracing both aspects</strong>, allowing yourself to soften into trust while maintaining your strength.</p>

<h3>Nervous System and Somatic Healing</h3>

<p>Through <strong>nervous system work, breathwork, somatic healing, and subconscious reprogramming</strong>, we begin to shift these deeply held patterns. Your nervous system plays a crucial role in all of this.</p>

<p>If it has been conditioned to associate struggle, scarcity, or chaos with safety, it will <strong>resist peace and abundance</strong>, even when they arrive. This is why healing the nervous system is so essential—it allows you to <strong>hold more love, joy, and success</strong> without fear or self-sabotage.</p>

<p>By reconnecting with yourself on this profound level, you cultivate <strong>deep self-trust, intuition, and a sense of worthiness</strong> that no longer relies on external validation. And from this place, your relationships—whether romantic, professional, or familial—begin to transform naturally.</p>

<p><strong>You are worthy of love, of abundance, of ease.</strong> The healing starts with you, and I am here to walk alongside you on this beautiful path of self-discovery and transformation.</p>

<h3>Healing Intimacy Wounds</h3>

<p>When we truly communicate, we aren’t just reacting—we’re <strong>consciously expressing ourselves with clarity and openness</strong>. Vulnerability is at the heart of deep connection, and creating a safe space for emotions to flow allows for real intimacy to blossom.</p>

<p>But so many of us carry <strong>deep-seated fears around intimacy</strong>, often without even realizing it.</p>

<p>For many, there’s an old, unspoken belief that intimacy isn’t safe. That if we open our hearts, we’ll be hurt. That vulnerability is a weakness. These subconscious fears often stem from childhood—times when we were told to "stop crying" or that expressing our emotions was too much. Over time, we learned to <strong>shut down parts of ourselves</strong> to avoid pain.</p>

<p><strong>Healing these wounds</strong> takes both emotional awareness and nervous system regulation. It’s about gently navigating our triggers with love and learning how to stay present in the moment rather than getting caught in old patterns.</p>

<h3>Stepping Into Self-Love and Power</h3>

<p>This is where <strong>self-love</strong> comes in—not just as a concept, but as a <strong>way of being</strong>. Embodying self-love means stepping into the role of the <strong>main character</strong> in your own life. It’s about no longer outsourcing your worth or battling imposter syndrome.</p>

<p>Instead, you become fully aligned with who you are—<strong>your values, your passions, your truth</strong>.</p>

<p>When we step into our power, we activate a beautiful transformation. The <strong>subconscious mind, the law of attraction, and the energy of self-worth</strong> all start working together to shift our reality.</p>

<p>And this shift isn't just about relationships—it’s about how we <strong>show up in every area of life</strong>.</p>

<p>For anyone who has been through toxic relationships or feels stuck in repeating cycles, one of the most powerful things you can do is <strong>create a vision for yourself</strong>—a vision where you are thriving, where you are stepping into the fullest expression of who you were always meant to be.</p>

<p>Without clarity, it’s easy to feel lost. But when you have a vision, even the smallest steps forward begin to feel <strong>purposeful</strong>.</p>
