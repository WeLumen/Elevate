    <span class="bar"></span> Section 2: The Inner Blocks That Sabotage Connection
</h2>
<p>Every woman I’ve coached—no matter how accomplished—has faced at least one of these inner blocks. These are not personal failings. They’re adaptive responses your nervous system built to keep you safe in environments that didn’t always reward visibility, authority, or authenticity.</p>
<p>Naming a pattern gives you power over it. In this section, you’ll meet 5 common internal blocks, learn how they show up in networking, and practice reframes that restore choice and presence.</p>

<h3>Use This Structure as You Work Each Block:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What it sounds like:</strong> Inner Script</li>
    <li><strong>Why it shows up:</strong> Protective Pattern</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> Supportive Belief</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> How to Show Up Differently</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.1 Fear of Being Judged or Not Taken Seriously</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inner Script:</strong> “Don’t be too much.” “Tone it down.” “Don’t make them uncomfortable.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protective Pattern:</strong> Many of us learn—implicitly or explicitly—that likability equals safety. We soften or shrink to avoid rejection, backlash, or stereotypes (too loud, too ambitious, too confident).</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> My presence has value. I don’t have to fit the room; I can invite the room to meet me.</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice:</strong> Before speaking, plant both feet, inhale slowly, exhale twice as long, and silently say: I bring value. Share one clear thing. Then speak a single strong statement (your role, mission, or current project).</li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> Lead with purpose instead of apology. For example: “I help small product brands scale their online visibility—curious what growth campaigns you’ve tried this quarter?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Overthinking or Analysis Paralysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inner Script:</strong> “Say the right thing.” “What if I mess this up?” “Rehearse…again.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protective Pattern:</strong> Your brain is trying to prevent embarrassment by perfecting the moment in advance. Unfortunately, networking happens in real time. Over-prepping pulls you out of presence and causes missed opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> Connection lives in presence, not perfection.</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice:</strong> Use the 3-Beat Drop-In: (1) Notice one thing you see, (2) one thing you hear, (3) one sensation in your body. Then speak—messy is okay.</li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> Ask a live, curious question instead of delivering a polished mini-pitch. Example: “What’s one project you’re excited about this month?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.3 Impostor Syndrome</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inner Script:</strong> “I don’t belong here.” “I just got lucky.” “Everyone else is more qualified.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protective Pattern:</strong> When visibility rises, your nervous system flags risk: If they see the real me, I’ll be rejected. Shrinking feels safer than being “found out.”</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> If I’m in the room, I have a reason to be here. My lived experience counts.</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice:</strong> Prep a Credibility Anchor Card (mental or note): 3 quick bullet points—achievement, experience, current project. Glance mentally before entering the room.</li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> Share context with confidence: “I’m leading the digital strategy for a regional retail group—we’re testing community-driven campaigns. What trends are you seeing in local engagement?”</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 People-Pleasing or Shrinking</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inner Script:</strong> “I don’t want to brag.” “I’ll just support others.” “I don’t want to take up space.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protective Pattern:</strong> Approval-seeking keeps relationships smooth but can erase your professional identity. You become the helper, not the collaborator, leader, or hire.</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> My voice adds value. Making space for myself makes space for others.</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice:</strong> Use Share-Ask Pairing: State one win (share), then immediately invite the other person (ask). Example: “I just wrapped a campaign that doubled email engagement. What’s been working in your list growth?”</li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> Practice balanced reciprocity—generous and visible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.5 Discomfort with Being Seen or Promoting Yourself</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inner Script:</strong> “Self-promotion is bragging.” “Visibility is ego.” “Stay humble.”</li>
    <li><strong>Protective Pattern:</strong> Cultural messaging around humility, gender expectations, or fear of backlash can make visibility feel risky or vain.</li>
    <li><strong>Reframe:</strong> Promoting my work honors its impact. Visibility serves the people I aim to help.</li>
    <li><strong>In-the-Moment Practice:</strong> Use the Impact Frame: Describe who you help + outcome. Example: “I support early-stage founders in launching digital campaigns that convert first-time customers into repeat buyers.”</li>
    <li><strong>Networking Shift:</strong> Speak from mission, not ego. When rooted in service, self-promotion becomes invitation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practice: Spot the Block</h3>
<p>Read each short networking moment below. Decide which internal block is most likely active, and rewrite the response.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You introduce yourself and immediately say, “It’s nothing big, I just…”<br><strong>Likely Block:</strong> People-Pleasing / Shrinking<br><strong>Shifted Response:</strong> “I help local service businesses turn referrals into repeat revenue.”</li>
    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You rehearse your role 5 times, then say nothing.<br><strong>Likely Block:</strong> Overthinking<br><strong>Shifted Response:</strong> Ask: “What kind of clients are you most energized to work with right now?”</li>
    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You downplay a new leadership role because you’re the youngest in the room.<br><strong>Likely Block:</strong> Impostor Syndrome<br><strong>Shifted Response:</strong> “I’m leading a new team overseeing content partnerships across regions.”</li>
    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You hesitate to share a bold idea fearing it’s too much.<br><strong>Likely Block:</strong> Fear of Judgment<br><strong>Shifted Response:</strong> “I’ve been testing a partnership model that tripled reach—open to hearing how it might translate here?”</li>
    <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You avoid mentioning your business online launches.<br><strong>Likely Block:</strong> Discomfort with Visibility<br><strong>Shifted Response:</strong> “I run a coaching cohort for women launching service-based brands; next round opens in September.”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>(Facilitator Tip: Turn this table into a worksheet. Participants circle the block and write their own reframe.)</blockquote>

<h3>Integration: Internal Alignment Check (Pre-Networking Ritual)</h3>
<p>Use this 2-minute reset before entering an event, meeting, or coffee chat.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Body Anchor:</strong> Plant feet; inhale 4, exhale 6 (3 rounds).</li>
    <li><strong>Name the Setting:</strong> Where am I? What’s my intention here?</li>
    <li><strong>Choose One Value to Lead With:</strong> Service, curiosity, collaboration, creativity, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice Statement:</strong> Say (out loud or silently): “I bring [value/skill]. I’m here to connect, not perform.”</li>
    <li><strong>First Question Ready:</strong> Prepare one warm, open question to invite conversation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reflection & Journaling</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Which of the 5 internal blocks shows up most often for you in professional conversation? Describe a recent moment.</li>
    <li>What message did you receive growing up about being visible, ambitious, or self-promotional?</li>
    <li>Write a compassionate response to the part of you that feels unsafe speaking up.</li>
    <li>Draft a 2-sentence Impact Frame introduction you can use this week.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guided Role Play (Small Groups or Pairs)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Partner A expresses hesitation (“I never know what to say; I don’t want to brag”). Partner B practices reflective listening + reframing.</li>
    <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Switch. Each partner delivers a 20-second Impact Frame intro followed by a curiosity-based question.</li>
    <li><strong>Round 3 (Stretch):</strong> Add a perceived power imbalance (e.g., speaking to a senior exec). Practice regulating nerves + holding ground.</li>
    <li><strong>Debrief:</strong> What shifted when you named your internal block out loud?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation Challenge (Between Sessions)</h3>
<p>Over the next 7 days:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the Internal Alignment Check before 1 real or virtual networking interaction.</li>
    <li>Track which block surfaced (if any) and what reframe you used.</li>
    <li>Share one reflection in the course community or next live call.</li>
</ul>
