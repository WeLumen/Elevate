          <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 3: Oppression Is Not Linear—It Intersects
        </h2>
        <p>Let’s take a moment to acknowledge a vital truth: oppression does not show up in a straight line. It does not knock politely, one system at a time.</p>
    <p>Instead, it weaves its way through our lives in overlapping, compounding ways. That’s why we use the term intersectionality—a concept introduced by civil rights scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw—to describe the lived reality that multiple forms of power and discrimination operate together, not separately.</p>
    <p>Racism, sexism, classism, ableism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia—they don’t exist in silos.</p>
    <p>They intersect. They amplify one another. And they shape how each of us experiences the world as women—very differently.</p>

    <h2>Why Intersectionality Matters in Feminism</h2>
    <p>When feminism fails to account for these intersections, it becomes shallow. It becomes exclusionary.</p>
    <p>A version of “empowerment” that only centers the voices of white, middle-class, able-bodied, cisgender, heterosexual women is not feminism—it’s partial liberation. And partial liberation, my love, is not enough.</p>
    <p>Let’s be real: feminism that erases difference can actually reinforce the very systems of oppression it claims to dismantle.</p>
    <p>When a woman of color speaks about the racism she faces within so-called “inclusive” feminist spaces and is labeled angry, divisive, or "too much"—that is erasure.</p>
    <p>When a disabled woman points out the lack of accessibility and is told it’s not “a priority right now”—that is exclusion.</p>
    <p>When a trans woman is questioned about her womanhood in a room meant to uplift women—that is violence disguised as dialogue.</p>
    <p>When a low-income woman is shamed for not having the time or money to attend events, retreats, or self-care practices—that is privilege masquerading as empowerment.</p>
    <p>These women aren’t causing conflict—they are revealing where the true conflicts already exist. They are not the problem—they are the truth-tellers.</p>

    <h2>Competition, Resentment, and Exhaustion Aren’t Personal—They’re Structural</h2>
    <p>So often, women are conditioned to believe that tension between us is a result of personal failings.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“She’s just dramatic.”</li>
        <li>“Why can’t we all just get along?”</li>
        <li>“Women can be so catty.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let’s call this out for what it really is: a misdiagnosis of a systemic problem.</p>
    <p>That sense of resentment or competition you might feel in a space isn’t coming from the women—it’s coming from the systems that pit us against each other. It’s coming from centuries of social structures that say there’s only room for one kind of woman, and the rest of us must fight for scraps of visibility, credibility, and dignity.</p>
    <p>This is not a personality issue.</p>
    <p>It’s not a flaw in sisterhood.</p>
    <p>It’s a byproduct of hierarchies within womanhood—and it’s time to dismantle them.</p>

    <h2>The Empowered Path Forward</h2>
    <p>As your empowerment coach, I want to lovingly challenge you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are you willing to recognize your own privilege—not as something to feel guilty about, but as a tool for advocacy?</li>
        <li>Are you ready to listen more deeply to women whose experiences don’t mirror your own—without defensiveness, without centering yourself?</li>
        <li>Are you open to expanding your definition of womanhood to include bodies, voices, and stories that have been erased for too long?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This work isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress. It’s about humility, courage, and deep connection.</p>
    <p>When we embrace intersectionality, we shift from individual empowerment to collective liberation.</p>
    <p>Because none of us are free until all of us are free.</p>
    <p>Let’s hold space for the complexity. Let’s amplify the voices that have been silenced. And let’s remember that empowerment is not just about finding your voice—it’s also about making space for others to speak.</p>
