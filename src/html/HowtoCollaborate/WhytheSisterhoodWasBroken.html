  </h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever wondered why women sometimes struggle to support each other, collaborate without comparison, or build genuine solidarity, it’s not because we’re naturally competitive or catty. It’s because we were conditioned to be. The disconnection among women has roots that go far deeper than personality or preference—it is deeply historical, systemic, and intentionally designed.</p>

    <h3>Patriarchal Systems: Survival Over Sisterhood</h3>
    <p>For centuries, and across cultures, the world was built by and for men. Patriarchal systems granted men ownership of power, property, education, decision-making, and even women’s bodies. Women were seen not as autonomous individuals but as extensions of male authority—fathers, husbands, kings, priests.</p>
    <p>This created a brutal reality: many women had to rely on men for survival. And when power is concentrated in the hands of a few, everyone else is forced into competition. Approval from a father, protection from a husband, access to resources through marriage—these were the few lifelines available. This survival-based system discouraged trust among women and replaced it with rivalry. Think about that: we were trained to see each other as threats, not allies.</p>

    <h3>Scarcity of Roles: Too Few Seats at the Table</h3>
    <p>For most of history, there was only “room” for one woman in a position of power. One queen. One female advisor. One token woman on the board. One woman in the classroom. In a world where women were excluded from leadership, public life, and wealth, the tiny openings that did exist were fiercely contested.</p>
    <p>When opportunities are limited, collaboration feels dangerous. Generationally, we’ve inherited a scarcity mindset—a belief that one woman’s success diminishes another’s. This belief is a lie. But for too long, it felt true. That lie has been internalized by many of us, making sisterhood feel risky instead of revolutionary.</p>

    <h3>Divide-and-Conquer Tactics: A Systemic Strategy</h3>
    <p>Here’s the truth: systems of oppression are smart. They know that the greatest threat to injustice is unity among the oppressed. That’s why powerful systems—from empires to corporations—have long employed divide-and-conquer tactics to keep marginalized groups fragmented.</p>
    <p>Women, especially, have been targeted by this strategy. Cultural narratives have praised the “cool girl” who distances herself from other women. Female ambition has been cast as “bitchy.” We’ve been taught to judge each other’s bodies, choices, and voices. Why? Because a woman preoccupied with judging another woman isn’t looking up at the system that’s keeping them both down.</p>
    <p>These tactics have worked for generations—but they don’t have to anymore.</p>

    <h2>Reclaiming Sisterhood</h2>
    <p>Understanding this history isn’t about blame—it’s about awakening. When we see the forces that shaped our disconnection, we can begin to dismantle them. We can rewrite the narrative.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We are not competitors. We are collaborators.</li>
        <li>We are not too much. We are powerful beyond measure.</li>
        <li>There is not just one seat at the table. There is room for all of us—or we build a bigger table.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As women reclaim leadership, wealth, education, and voice, we must also reclaim our commitment to one another. This is how we rise—not in isolation, but arm in arm.</p>
    <p><strong>Sisterhood is not a luxury. It is a strategy. It is a revolution. And it starts with us.</strong></p>
