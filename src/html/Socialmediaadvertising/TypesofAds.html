    <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 2: Types of Ads
  </h2>

  <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Static Image  </h2>

    <p>The static image format remains one of the most universal on social media. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it ideal for promoting products or services directly and without distractions. This format is used on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, allowing brands to communicate quickly and visually with their audiences. Static images are especially useful for campaigns that aim to deliver clear and simple messages, such as offers, launches, or promotions. Although it might seem like a basic format, visual creativity is key to standing out among the multitude of posts users see daily. </p>
    <p>It’s important to check the appropriate dimensions for creating images for our campaigns on each platform. On Instagram, vertical formats are commonly used, while on Facebook, for example, horizontal ones might be more suitable. Additionally, we should verify the safe areas in images so that our text is always visible and readable. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Short Videos</h2>

    <p>Video content has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its ability to capture users' attention within seconds. Short videos, which can last between 6 and 30 seconds, are the ideal format for telling quick, visual stories that engage the audience. This format is widely used on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, and YouTube. The dynamic nature of short videos allows brands to showcase products, quick tutorials, or promotional messages in a creative and entertaining way. Platforms have adapted this format to fit smoothly into their feeds and posts, offering a direct visual experience without long interruptions. </p>
    <p>Whether they are Reels on Instagram or short videos on TikTok, vertical in any case, the key is to capture users’ attention in the first three seconds of the video and, with that, increase retention rates. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Carousels</h2>

    <p>The carousel is an interactive format that allows users to swipe through multiple images or videos within a single post. This versatility makes it an effective tool for telling brand stories, showing different aspects of a product, or presenting an entire product line. This format is available on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn, and is especially useful for e-commerce, where businesses can showcase multiple products or features in a single ad. By offering more than one visual message within the same space, the carousel invites users to interact longer with the ad, increasing the likelihood of conversion. </p>
    <p>On Instagram, carousels can currently include up to 20 pieces and can mix photos and videos. What’s important in this case is consistency to tell a story through the carousel. </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Stories</h2>

    <p>Stories are one of the most versatile and popular formats on social media, available on Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, TikTok, and LinkedIn. Story posts, which last 24 hours, allow brands to generate ephemeral and authentic content. Their full-screen vertical format maximises visual impact, and their short duration helps maintain users' attention. Additionally, they offer interactive options like polls, quizzes, and direct links, making them a powerful tool for quick promotions, last-minute announcements, or more personal content that connects with the audience.</p>
    <p>Advertising formats in stories usually include several frames where we can develop our message and, finally, link to our website or trigger a CTA (Call to Action). </p>
<h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Streaming Ads (Video and Audio)</h2>

    <p>Streaming content has opened new advertising opportunities in both video and audio. Platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and Spotify allow brands to insert ads during live streams or music sessions. On YouTube, pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll videos are common ways to integrate ads without excessively interrupting the content flow. Twitch, with its interactive nature, offers brands the chance to collaborate directly with streamers to mention products or services during the broadcast. On Spotify, audio and video ads play intermittently between songs, giving brands the opportunity to connect with users while they are immersed in their playlists.  </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span>Live Video Ads</h2>

    <p>The live video format has grown in popularity, especially on platforms like Instagram Live, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, and Twitch. Brands can interact directly with their audiences through live broadcasts, allowing them to showcase products in real time, answer questions, or carry out immediate launches. These types of ads are ideal for events, product demonstrations, or interactive tutorials, where immediacy and interaction play a crucial role in the user experience. Additionally, the live format creates a greater sense of authenticity and closeness, which can increase audience engagement.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span>Sponsored Pins</h2>

    <p>On Pinterest, ads in the form of sponsored pins allow brands to reach a visually-oriented audience. Sponsored pins can include images or videos and continue to appear in users' feeds long after the campaign has run, generating ongoing traffic towards products or services. Pinterest is a platform where users actively seek inspiration and products related to home decor, fashion, or lifestyle, making it an ideal space for those selling visually appealing items.</p>

     <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span>Collaborative Advertising with Influencers</h2>

  <p>Influencer marketing has introduced a new advertising format that allows brands to reach specific audiences through the voice of trusted individuals. Collaborations can take different forms, such as sponsored posts, where influencers mention or review products, or unboxings, where influencers open products in front of their followers and share their first impressions. Another popular option is live content, where influencers interact directly with their followers while recommending products or services. Sponsored challenges, especially on TikTok, allow brands to naturally integrate into the platform’s viral trends. This format is ideal for SMEs looking for authenticity and a closer connection with their target audience without requiring huge investments.</p>
