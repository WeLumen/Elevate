    <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 1: Main Platforms
  </h2>
  <p>
    There is a wide range of platforms and formats, making the creation of social media advertising seem quite complex. The key is to know your target audience thoroughly—who you want to reach and what you hope to achieve from them. This understanding will significantly narrow down the types of ads you’ll create and, importantly, where you will place those ads. 
  </p>

  <p>Therefore, rather than focusing on which platforms are currently popular, it’s crucial to consider whether those platforms align with the preferences of your potential customers. Additionally, it’s important to assess the ability to create ads targeted by audience type and, for small, local businesses, the capability to reach only within the business's geographical area of influence. This allows you to choose, target, and reach the right people effectively.</p>

  <h4>And which platforms are the most useful right now?</h4>

  
<div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Facebook</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Facebook remains essential for certain audience segments due to its precise targeting capabilities and budget flexibility. Businesses can start with small budgets and still reach a relevant audience. Additionally, tools like Facebook Live enable real-time connections with potential customers without extra costs. It’s a platform that is particularly popular among mature adults, both men and women, with middle-to-high incomes. Its diverse user base makes it excellent for reaching a broad audience.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Instagram</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Instagram stands out as the preferred platform for businesses that rely on visual content. Its ads in Stories and Reels are relatively affordable and can be effective, while Instagram Live allows real-time interaction with followers at no extra cost. Instagram Shopping facilitates access from profiles to online stores, potentially boosting sales. It is especially popular among young people aged 18 to 35, mostly women, with an interest in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle, and with a medium to high purchasing power.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">WhatsApp Business </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      WhatsApp is an excellent option for those who value direct communication with customers. It offers free tools such as product catalogues, quick replies, and personalised support, making it an interesting platform for building close relationships with users. In Spain, it is the leading messaging platform.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Meta</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      After discussing Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram, it’s important to remember that all these platforms are part of the Meta ecosystem. This allows the creation of campaigns in their Business Manager, where you can choose the target audience, and the system automatically serves ads on the appropriate platform.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">TikTok</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      For those looking to reach younger audiences, and not-so-young ones, TikTok can be a key platform. With the increasing challenge of having creative videos go viral without large budgets, paid advertising isn't always necessary. TikTok Live enables real-time interaction with followers, making it an excellent choice for organically increasing engagement. TikTok's audience is primarily young people aged 16 to 30, interested in entertainment and pop culture, with middle incomes, making it perfect for creative and fresh campaigns.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Linkedin</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      For businesses operating in the B2B sector, LinkedIn remains a crucial platform. While ads can seem more expensive than on other platforms, organic posts and participation in professional groups are cost-effective strategies. LinkedIn Live is a valuable tool for hosting webinars or live presentations. Most LinkedIn users are professionals aged 25 to 45, with high incomes and advanced education, making it an ideal space to reach decision-makers.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">YouTube</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Video remains one of the most powerful tools, and YouTube is accessible to everyone. While advertising campaigns can be tailored to tight budgets, creating organic content is an excellent way to generate traffic and visibility. YouTube Live allows you to broadcast live events, such as product launches or tutorials, without the need for additional investments. YouTube is used by a diverse audience, ranging from teenagers to adults in their 50s, with the largest group being 18-34-year-olds, making it accessible for brands looking for a varied audience interested in visual products.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Pinterest</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Pinterest stands out as an excellent choice for brands working in visual sectors such as fashion, decoration, or design. Ads on Pinterest can be less costly than on other platforms, and sponsored pins continue to drive traffic over time. With a high percentage of female users (around 70%) aged 25 to 50, Pinterest is the perfect platform for reaching people interested in shopping for home-related products, fashion, and crafts, typically with a medium-to-high purchasing power.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">X (formerly Twitter) </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
     X is an ideal platform for brands that want to interact quickly and constantly with their audience. While advertising on X can be expensive, organic content can still be effective for participating in relevant conversations. The audience on X is mainly young, aged 25 to 40, with a higher proportion of men interested in technology, news, and entertainment, with middle-to-high incomes, making it a good option for brands looking to position themselves in specific sectors. It is also the ideal platform for generating real-time content related to current events. This allows brands to join trends and reach a much larger audience. It’s how a plumbing company like “Desatranques Jaén” managed to gain recognition and build a digital presence. 
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Threads</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Threads is an emerging platform that, being integrated with Instagram, offers a quick and seamless way to interact with followers without requiring large budgets. It is a natural extension for brands already present on Instagram, allowing lighter and more frequent conversations. Its audience is mainly young people aged 18 to 35, leaning towards women and content about lifestyle, fashion, and culture. It already has 200 million monthly users and is growing, with many coming directly from Instagram and others who are disillusioned with X.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item2">
    <div class="accordion-header">Twitch</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      Twitch, although initially focused on video games, has become a relevant platform for anyone looking to reach a young and engaged audience through live content. Collaborations with smaller streamers offer a cost-effective option for promoting products in an organic way. It can be used to stream events or showcase products in real-time without requiring large investments. Most Twitch users are young men between the ages of 18 and 35, interested in technology, entertainment, and geek culture, with moderate incomes, making it an ideal space for brands that want to explore interactive live content.

  <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Online Influencers</h2>

    <p>Influencer marketing has established itself as a powerful communication tool. By working with influencers, brands can reach specific audiences through a voice that already generates trust among their followers. For a small business, the key lies in collaborating with micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) or nano-influencers (fewer than 10K followers), as they usually have higher engagement and offer more affordable rates than major digital celebrities.</p>
    <p>Influencers create personalised content on their profiles that directly connects with their followers, which can increase a brand's visibility without requiring significant advertising investments. Moreover, they can use various formats, such as reviews, unboxings, mentions in stories, or live videos, adapting to different budgets and business needs. </p>
    <p>These types of collaborations are especially useful for brands in visual sectors, such as fashion, beauty, technology, gastronomy, and more. What matters is that a trusted person's opinion can make a difference. Influencers enable a business, which may not have a large budget, to stand out in the social conversation without needing to resort to formal ads. </p>
    <p>The ages and demographics of an influencer’s followers vary depending on the person you collaborate with, but generally, their audience is young, between 18 and 35 years old, with incomes ranging from medium to high, and a strong interest in direct recommendations about products and experiences. </p>
    <p>Additionally, many influencers are “local,” specific to a particular city. This means their audience is highly segmented and not necessarily tied to a particular sector. For small local businesses, collaborating with this type of influencer can be key.</p>
