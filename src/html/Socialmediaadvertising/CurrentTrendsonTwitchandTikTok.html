      <h3>1. The Value of Twitch for Brands/Users</h3>
      <p>Twitch is a unique platform where users consume content in real time, making it an ideal space for brands looking to build an authentic connection. Through live interaction, brands can become part of streamers' communities, achieving global reach with a more personalised approach. Twitch offers an environment where users seek entertainment and community, providing brands with opportunities to engage in genuine conversations that resonate deeply with audiences.</p>
  

   
      <h3>2. Engagement</h3>
      <p>Twitch fosters constant and direct engagement through real-time interaction. Users actively participate in streamers' chats, allowing brands to interact directly with their audience in an immediate and authentic way. One of the most effective strategies for brands is to leverage streamers as ambassadors. Twitch streamers have highly engaged communities that value their opinions, making brand collaborations with influencers crucial for increasing visibility and building trust. Using elements like giveaways, live challenges, and polls during streams are effective ways to maintain active participation. </p>
    

    
      <h3>3. Content</h3>
      <p>Content on Twitch is characterised by its authenticity and spontaneity. Streamers often create a relaxed and unscripted atmosphere that resonates well with audiences seeking a genuine experience. Brands can capitalise on this by sponsoring live streams, conducting interviews, or creating exclusive events.</p>
   

    
          <h3>4. Metrics</h3>
      <p>Metrics on Twitch focus on real-time engagement and the reach of each live broadcast. Metrics like Average Concurrent Viewership (ACV), which measures the average number of viewers throughout a broadcast, are essential for assessing campaign success.</p>
    

  
      <h3>5. What Works on Twitch?</h3>
      <p>A brand's success on Twitch lies in allowing users to participate actively in content creation. Campaigns that promote direct participation, such as giveaways or interactive challenges where viewers can influence the outcome of streams, generate high levels of engagement.</p>


  <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> TikTok
  </h2>

 
      <h3>1. The Value of TikTok for Brands/Users</h3>
      <p>TikTok has become an essential platform for brands thanks to its ability to connect with audiences in an authentic and creative way. The combination of creativity, spontaneity, and free expression that it encourages among both users and brands generates a deep connection with audiences.</p>
   

    
      <h3>2. Engagement</h3>
      <p>Engagement on TikTok has transformed the way brands interact with their audiences. Tools like Hashtag Challenges invite followers to become active participants in content creation, making users direct participants in brand communication. </p>
    

   
      <h3>3. Content</h3>
      <p>Creativity and authenticity are at the core of TikTok's community, driving the trends that originate on the platform. This provides a unique opportunity for brands to engage with a diverse and global audience.</p>
    

    
          <h3>4. Metrics</h3>
      <p>TikTok not only stands out for its creative capabilities but also for its focus on authenticity and humanising brands.</p>
    

   
      <h3>5. What Works on TikTok</h3>
      <p>Success on TikTok lies in allowing users to become natural ambassadors for the brand. Brands that enable their users to create content around their products or services not only encourage engagement but also foster a deeper emotional connection. When users feel like they are part of the brand, they promote their affinity for it in a creative and authentic manner. </p>
      <p>On TikTok, creativity is the key to success. The most successful brands are those that embrace and encourage the authenticity of the community. Instead of following a traditional advertising approach, brands that adapt to TikTok’s unique and expressive style achieve a stronger connection with their audience and promote genuine and creative conversations.</p>
    
  <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Organic Content and Collaborations with Creators
  </h2>

  <p>In addition to paid formats, TikTok encourages the creation of organic content through its Creator Marketplace, a tool that connects brands with creators who best align with their message. This allows brands to collaborate with influencers and leverage the creativity of the community to produce authentic and viral campaigns. A notable example is the use of the hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, where creators share product recommendations, making TikTok a key platform for social commerce. </p>
