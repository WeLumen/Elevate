    <p>Selecting the right platforms should not be based on trends or purely tactical criteria. It requires a strategic deep dive, creating a process that avoids human biases and relies on organised information and data.</p>

    <p>Managing social media marketing and communication logically involves a strategy that goes beyond mere tactics.</p>

    <p>Many companies jump straight into tactical actions without taking the necessary preliminary steps.</p>

    <p>The iceberg metaphor simplifies this approach. Imagine an iceberg where the tip represents the tactical actions implemented on different platforms, but beneath the surface lies the larger part of the iceberg: the strategic process that led to selecting the right tactical actions on the right platforms. Let’s review the different phases of the strategic process.</p>

   <div class="section-box">
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      A strategic starting point is impossible without setting clear objectives. These objectives will determine not only which platforms to use but also the tone and content focus. Take time to define what you are aiming for with your social media presence. If we consider a classic conversion funnel, which part are we targeting?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Brand Awareness</li>
      <li>Interest</li>
      <li>Consideration</li>
      <li>Engagement</li>
      <li>Conversion</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section-box">
    <h2>Loyalty</h2>
    <p>
      If no one knows about your brand, you’ll need to work on the top of the funnel, such as brand awareness, and some platforms will be better suited for this purpose than others. Hence, selecting the primary goal carefully is crucial as it guides the rest of the social media strategy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-box">
    <h2>Listening </h2>
  </div>

   <div class="video-section">

  </video>
  </div>

  <p>
     Knowing your starting point is key. After setting objectives, we assume our brand or product is positioned at a specific point in the funnel. However, listening to what is being said about us is essential. This allows us to determine if people speak positively or negatively about us, check if we have set the right objectives, and better understand our audience. 
    </p>
    <p>Understanding our reputational positioning on social media is critical, as knowing how people perceive us provides insight into how they interact with us and the relationship we build. One of the biggest risks for a brand is being ignored altogether, which means a lack of engagement, whether positive or negative. Our aim should always be to earn positive mentions around our brand. Finding and assessing negative comments can help us improve what triggers them, viewing it as an opportunity for growth. Being ignored entirely is worse, as it signifies irrelevance. </p>

    <div class="section-box1">
    <h2>How to Conduct Listening?</h2>
    <p>There are various tools available, most of which are paid, to automate the listening process. Free methods involve manual searches on each social network, requiring time investment and resulting in a loss of real-time control. Subscribed tools charge based on the number of mentions we want to monitor, so it’s crucial to be precise about what we want to listen for to avoid overspending.</p>
    
    <p>Here are some examples of listening tools, although the market is dynamic, constantly evolving its algorithms. What is the best listening tool? It depends on many factors, so there’s no definitive answer. Here are a few that might be useful:</p>

    <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Google Alerts:</strong> Although it might seem basic, it’s still useful for detecting new websites where your brand or service is mentioned.</li>
      <li><strong>Sentisis:</strong> A Spanish tool designed from the ground up for the Spanish language, with a highly efficient natural language processing engine.</li>
      <li><strong>BrandWatch:</strong> A popular and versatile commercial tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprinklr:</strong> An excellent tool for both listening and daily social media management.</li>
      <li><strong>TalkWalker:</strong> Integrates with Hootsuite for social media management.</li>
      <li><strong>Digimind:</strong> Effective for brand reputation monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Mention:</strong> A slightly less powerful but more affordable option.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section-box1">
    <h2>What Should Listening Include?</h2>
    <p>We recommend conducting an initial listening report before any social media activities, analysing conversations around the brand or product. This first phase should take 4–6 weeks to ensure a large and representative sample without distortions from one-off events.</p>
    <p>Listening should continue throughout the life of the social media accounts, monitoring each channel daily: who is talking, what is being said, and the tone of the conversation.</p>
    <p>The goal is to identify the types of conversations and comments occurring on social media and understand how the brand or product is perceived online. This listening serves as the foundation for crafting a tailored social media strategy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-box1">
    <h2>Platform Analysis</h2>
    <p>Basic platforms for analysis include search engines, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, blogs, and forums.</p>
    <p>Of course, many questions arise during this listening process: </p>

    <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>What is being said?</strong></li>
      <p> Is the conversation positive, negative, or neutral? Most listening tools automatically classify conversations based on their sentiment, but manual review is needed to catch false positives and negatives. Remember, detecting sarcasm or irony can be difficult for algorithms—and even for some people.</p>

       <li><strong>Who is saying it? </strong></li>
      <p> Brands often become overly concerned with every mention on social media. It’s important to know if the person talking is an actual or potential customer. If not, it’s worth assessing whether they are simply “haters” or influential critics who could trigger an online reputation crisis. </p>
      <li><strong>Where is it being said? </strong></li>
      <p> Monitoring where conversations happen is key since comments don’t move at the same speed or reach on every platform. TikTok, X, and Instagram are usually more real-time, but forums or review sites can also be crucial for brand conversations. </p>
      <li><strong>What is the competition doing? </strong></li>
      <p> There’s no need to set up the same level of listening as for your brand. It would be too expensive to monitor all competitors, and the benefits wouldn’t justify the costs. Instead, evaluate the content territories each competitor is working on and the tactical actions they’re deploying across different platforms. This helps identify unexplored areas and avoid repeating tactics that could lead to reputational issues for your brand. </p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Know Your Audience</h2>
  </div>


    <blockquote class="quote">
      "If strategy is the art of getting others to do something, the strategist is obliged to understand their audience. They need to know why the audience is here, whether they want to be here, what they have seen before, what their successes and failures have been, what they know and believe, what prejudices they carry, and what expectations they have”.
