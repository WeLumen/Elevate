    <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 3: Strategies for Creating Relevant Content
  </h2>
   <blockquote class="quote">
      “After all, indifference towards your audience and the reality in which they live, as paraphrased from Dieter Rams, is the only capital sin.”
      <p class="author">Martin Weigel</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Having a deep understanding of the audience you want to engage is essential. You need to find the intersection between what your brand wants to communicate and what interests your audience. To do this, you should create detailed profiles of your target audiences using various information sources to paint a clear picture of how they behave on social media platforms. </p>
    <p>Numerous public reports provide data on platform usage, and the platforms themselves often offer demographic data. Additionally, independent reports like those from IAB in the UK offer comprehensive statistical information on social media usage.</p>
    <p>By analysing how your brand is perceived, understanding your audience well, and knowing your competitors, you will be able to create tactical content that truly resonates with them. </p>

  <p>When we reach this stage, we will be ready to develop our strategy and, from there, implement the tactical actions. The strategy is the *“how”*, not the *“what”*. Therefore, it is crucial to carry out a thorough strategic process before developing anything. There must be a balance between the quality of the strategy and the impact of the tactical actions.</p>

   <blockquote class="quote">
      “A strategy without tactical actions is the slowest path to victory. Tactical actions without strategy are the noise before defeat.”
      <p class="author">Sun Tzu </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let’s therefore take special care to start from a strategy and remember that our practical, tactical application should meet the following requirements.   </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Tactical Application of a Strategy on Social Media
  </h2>
  <p>The tactical application of a strategy on social media is based on the creation and distribution of relevant content that delivers real value to the audience. This content should be designed to meet both the informative and entertainment needs of users, making it the core of any successful social media strategy.</p>
 <div class="section">
    <h2>Content that Delivers Value</h2>
    <p>The content we share must serve a purpose: to be useful, whether it provides practical information, solves problems, answers common questions, or simply offers a moment of fun and emotional connection. For example:</p>
    <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Useful Information:</strong> Guides, tutorials, or tips that help users better understand a topic, product, or service.</li>
      <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Light-hearted content like videos, memes, or challenges that invite the audience to interact and have fun.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Emotional and Rational Reasons</h2>
    <p>People connect with a brand or product on both emotional and rational levels. Here is where content plays a key role:</p>
    <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Emotional Reason:</strong> Content can appeal to the feelings and values of the audience. This could be through inspiring stories, touching images, or experiences that generate empathy.</li>
      <li><strong>Rational Reason:</strong> At the same time, it’s important to offer a logical and convincing reason to engage, such as showing the benefits of a product, explaining how a solution can improve their lives, or providing useful data to support their decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
<h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Relevant Content Should Be
  </h2>

<div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">1. It Should Be a “Big Idea”</div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      For content to stand out in a saturated environment like social media, it needs to be born from a big idea. This idea must not only be original but also memorable and powerful enough to capture the audience's attention within seconds. A big idea has the potential to resonate emotionally and immediately connect with the audience. Whether through a compelling narrative, impactful visual concept, or an innovative proposal, the big idea is what will set your content apart from the rest and ensure it stays in the user’s mind.

      <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> Think of viral challenges that set trends. Behind them, there is always a big idea that motivates people to engage massively. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">2. Built on Insights and Truths </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      The most effective content is based on deep insights into the behaviour, motivations, and needs of your target audience. These insights are essential human truths that allow you to create content that truly speaks the consumer's language. Building on these pillars makes the content more authentic and fosters an emotional connection with users. 
 An insight can reveal something that the audience feels but may not necessarily express directly, and this presents the perfect opportunity for a brand to address it in a relevant way. When content is based on a clear and universally understandable truth, it becomes much more credible and persuasive. 

      <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> A campaign addressing the daily frustrations of remote working or the search for a work-life balance are insights that emotionally connect with many people today. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

   <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">3. The Initial Way to Capture the Public's Attention and Participation </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
     Content should be the gateway to capturing your audience’s attention on social media. Here, the first few seconds are crucial. Capturing attention quickly through an image, a headline, or a strong call to action is the first step in inviting the public to engage and explore further. 
 But grabbing attention isn’t enough. It’s important to design content that invites interaction, whether through comments, shares, or participation in polls or contests. The content should encourage participation without feeling forced, giving people convincing reasons to get involved. 

      <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Example:</strong>A video that starts with an intriguing question or a challenge is a common tactic for capturing attention and getting users to stay until the end and engage. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

   <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">4. A Sustainable Way to Develop Relationships </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
    Content should not only be impactful in the short term but should also function as a bridge for building long-term relationships with the audience. For brands, this means that every piece of content should consistently deliver value, so users are not just interested once but keep coming back for more. This can be achieved through consistency, authenticity, and using a tone and voice that align with the brand's identity.
Through content, brands can cultivate a community around their values and value proposition, maintaining continuous interaction with users to reinforce trust and loyalty. Long-term relationships are ultimately what drive loyalty and the organic growth of the brand. 

      <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Example:</strong>A content strategy that includes tutorials, practical guides, or exclusive content is ideal for maintaining interest and fostering a long-term relationship with the audience.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-item">
    <div class="accordion-header">5. Understandable and Aligned with People’s Needs and Interests </div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
    For content to truly connect, it must be understandable and relevant to the target audience's needs and interests. Simplicity and clarity are essential; if the message is not clear from the start, it’s likely that users will lose interest. The content should be tailored to the audience’s knowledge level and preferences, ensuring that it adds value to their everyday lives.
Moreover, the content should align with the audience’s interests and priorities. Whether it’s educational, entertaining, or inspiring, it should solve a problem, answer a question, or simply provide something users enjoy. If the content is perceived as useful and aligned with users' concerns or desires, its chances of success increase exponentially. 

      <ul class="tools-list">
      <li><strong>Example:</strong>Creating content that specifically addresses common questions from your audience or discusses current issues, such as industry trends or everyday challenges, is a way to ensure that what you publish is understood and valued. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  
  <div class="conclusion-content">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  
      <p>
        The tactical application of a strategy on social media is not just about posting content randomly; it’s about creating a clear value proposition that truly resonates with the audience. Users need to feel inspired, both emotionally and rationally, to engage with the brand and share their experience with others. This makes content a powerful tool for building relationships, generating concrete actions, and fostering a loyal community that advocates for the brand.
