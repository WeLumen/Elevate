    <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 3: Audience Segmentation
  </h2>

  
    <h3>1. Defining the General Target Audience</h3>
    <p>The first step is to understand who your ideal audience is. This involves creating ideal customer profiles or "buyer personas" that include details such as age, gender, location, purchasing power, occupation, interests, and buying behaviours. For example, a small business selling sustainable fashion may focus on individuals aged 25 to 45 who are interested in responsible consumption and have a medium-high purchasing power.</p>


    <h3>2. Demographic and Geographic Segmentation</h3>
    <p>Advertising platforms allow you to segment users based on their demographics (age, gender) and geographic location (cities, regions, or even specific areas around a store). For local businesses, it is crucial to limit segmentation to their area of influence. You can also segment by language if your audience speaks a particular language. </p>
    <p>Due to the importance and impact of geographic segmentation, let's explore it further: </p>
    <p>Geographic segmentation is a crucial aspect especially if their offerings are concentrated in a specific region or area. This type of segmentation allows businesses to target their advertising campaigns to users located in precise geographic locations, such as cities, regions, or even a defined radius around a physical store. The goal is to display ads to people near the business’s location or in key areas where potential customers are found. </p>
    <p>Platforms that Allow Geographic Segmentation:</p>

    <h4>Facebook and Instagram Ads  </h4>

    <p>Both platforms, which share the same ad management tool (Meta Ads Manager), offer highly detailed geographic segmentation. You can select countries, regions, cities, or even set a specific radius around a particular location. They also allow postal code targeting, which is particularly useful when looking to attract local customers.   </p>

  <ul><li><strong>Example: </strong> If a brand has a physical sports goods store in central Madrid, it can target its campaign to show ads to people within a five-kilometre radius around the store. This can be combined with interests like running or cycling, ensuring the ads reach active individuals who might be interested in sports products. </li></ul>

  <h4>Google Ads  </h4>

    <p>Google Ads allows for precise geographic targeting for search network ads, display ads, and YouTube ads. In addition to targeting countries, regions, and cities, Google Ads offers the option to target users searching for terms related to a specific location or those physically present in a particular area. This is especially useful for small businesses wanting to drive traffic to their physical store or attract local customers for specific services.</p>

  <ul><li><strong>Example: </strong>A café in Barcelona aiming to attract tourists can create ads targeting people in the city searching for "best coffee in Barcelona" or related terms. Google Ads allows the café to show these ads to people who, based on their searches or current location, are interested in finding a nearby café. </li></ul>

  <h4>TikTok Ads </h4>
  
    <p>Although newer in terms of advertising, TikTok Ads offers geographic targeting options, allowing businesses to reach users in specific geographic areas. This segmentation is useful for businesses looking to attract a younger audience or increase local visibility among users who consume a lot of content on this platform.   </p>

  <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong>A healthy food restaurant in Valencia can create engaging visual content and target its ads to users located in the city. It can also use popular hashtags in the region and related to healthy eating to boost visibility.</li></ul>

  <h4>LinkedIn Ads</h4>
  
    <p>LinkedIn is ideal for businesses offering B2B services or products aimed at professionals. The platform allows for geographic segmentation by country, region, city, and metropolitan area, combining it with professional characteristics such as job title, industry, or the company where the user works.   </p>

  <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A small agency offering consultancy services for tech startups in Granada could create a targeted ad campaign to show ads only to people in Granada’s province working in the tech sector. This ensures their ads reach a relevant audience within a geographic area where the entrepreneurial ecosystem is concentrated.</li></ul>

  <h4>YouTube Ads</h4>
  
    <p>Managed through Google Ads, YouTube ads offer similar geographic targeting options as Google's display network. This enables businesses to target their audience based on geographic location, along with demographic traits and interests. For local businesses, it’s possible to reach users near a physical store or in areas where the business has a stronger presence.</p>

  <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> A yoga studio in Seville can create an advert featuring classes and testimonials from satisfied customers, then target the ad on YouTube to people living in or visiting Seville, maximising opportunities to attract new local clients. </li></ul>

  <h2 class="section-title">
    <span class="bar"></span> Exemple</h2>
      <p><b>Examples of Geographic Segmentation Strategies:</b></p>

      <p><b>1. Very Local Business with a Physical Store</b><br>
      If you have a physical store or restaurant, geographic segmentation should focus on attracting people who live or work nearby...</p>

      <p><b>2. Business Offering Regional or National Services</b><br>
      If your business offers services regionally, you can use a broader segmentation...</p>

      <p><b>3. Tourism-focused Businesses or those Targeting Tourists</b><br>
      For businesses that rely on tourism, geographic segmentation is ideal for attracting visitors...</p>
    
 
    <h3>3. Interest and Behavioural Segmentation</h3>
    <p>A more advanced option is to segment your audience according to their interests and behaviours. Platforms allow you to target people who have already shown interest in certain topics (like fashion, wellness, or technology) or who have relevant behaviours, such as frequency of online purchases or the type of devices they use. This helps refine the campaign to reach those who are more likely to be interested in the product or service. </p>
  
    <h3>4. Connection-based Segmentation</h3>
    <p>You can leverage the existing relationship users have with your brand. This includes targeting people who already follow your page, have interacted with your posts, or have visited your website. These audiences are ideal for remarketing campaigns as they target users who are already familiar with your brand and are more likely to convert. </p>
  
    <h3>5. Lookalike Audiences</h3>
    <p>Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow you to create lookalike audiences based on your current customers' characteristics. If you have a customer database or email list, you can use it to create an audience with similar profiles, broadening your reach to new users who share interests or behaviours with your existing customers.</p>
 
    <h3>6. Segmentation by Conversion Funnel Stage</h3>
    <p>It is essential to segment users according to their stage in the conversion funnel. In the "brand awareness" stage, you target broader audiences who might not yet know your brand. In the "consideration" stage, you can focus your ads on those who have interacted with your content, like visiting your website. In the "conversion" stage, you can target users who have shown explicit interest, such as those who have added products to their cart or visited the pricing page.</p>
    <h3>7. Device-based Segmentation</h3>
    <p>If your online store is mobile-optimised or you have an app, it’s advisable to target users using mobile devices. You can also segment by device type (iOS vs. Android), which is useful if your app or product is only available for a particular operating system. </p>
 
    <h3>8. Using Influencers for Segmentation</h3>
    <p>Collaborating with influencers is an effective strategy for audience segmentation. By working with an influencer, you can directly reach their followers, who often share interests and characteristics relevant to your business. For example, if you sell fitness products, an influencer in this field will attract an audience likely interested in your products. Additionally, you can tailor the collaboration according to the influencer’s audience (local, regional, or global), allowing for even more precise segmentation</p>
  
    <h3>9. Continuous Optimisation and A/B Testing</h3>
    <p>It is crucial to carry out A/B tests to determine which segmentation combinations yield better results. You can test different ages, locations, interests, or behaviours and adjust your campaign based on the outcomes. For a small business, this process is key, as it helps to optimise every pound invested in advertising.</p>
