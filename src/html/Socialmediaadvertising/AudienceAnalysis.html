    <span class="bar"></span> Lesson 3: Audience Analysiss
  </h2>

<p>The main element of any content strategy is to know our audience perfectly; the biggest mistake a brand can make is not understanding the audience it wants to reach. If we do not know our audience, we may fall into the trap of speaking only about what matters to us without knowing what interests them. We must seek the common ground between our interests and our audience's interests; only then can we connect, build audiences, and create genuine positive engagement with them.</p>

<h2 class="main-title">
Key Elements in a Content Strategy </h2>

    <div class="list-section">
      <h3>Target Audience </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Who are we addressing?</li>
        <li>What motivates them?</li>
        <li>What do they need in their daily lives?</li>
        <li>Where do they consume content?</li>
        <li>How do they consume content?</li>
        <li>How can I surprise them?</li>
        <li>How can I entertain them? </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>These and many more are the questions we should ask ourselves to correctly profile our audience.</p>
    <p>We can have different target segments depending on the objectives. In fact, it is better to have personalised segmentations for each type of objective.</p>
    <div class="list-section">
      <h3>Territories and Voice </h3>

      <p>Content territories are fundamental for any brand; identifying those content topics where we can be recognised as leaders, either because they are intrinsic to our product or because we use them to build brand reputation, is vital. It is important to focus on the main topics and not disperse efforts. Analysing the territories that our competitors occupy is essential to accurately assess where to centre our efforts; either because it is an untapped territory or because we have authority in that space. </p>
      <p>We must evaluate which topics your potential customers want to consume.</p>
      <p>And how can we find our territories to align them with those topics they want to consume?</p>
      <p>Imagine you have an onion—yes, the vegetable. Place your brand, your essence, at the core. Let's use a beauty brand that offers more hydrating products than the competition as an example. Now place the brand's products and services in the next layer. The important part comes next; think about the benefits of these products. The benefits can be functional (it hydrates more than the rest) or emotional (using it boosts self-confidence). We then arrive at the final layer, which represents the territories. By evaluating the overall benefits we have, we will only need to develop content around them. In the example we have seen, we could leverage our content on beauty tips and advice on enhancing personality.  </p>
      <p>What voice will the brand have across all channels? How do we want it to relate to audiences on different platforms?   </p>
      <p>The fundamental aspect is to be consistent with the brand's voice across all channels. Although there may be channels that differ significantly from one another, for example, TikTok vs LinkedIn, our brand should maintain a recognisable voice across all platforms. Adapting to the communication style of each platform should not lead to having different voices; our clients should recognise the brand consistently, regardless of the platform on which they consume the content.</p>
      </div>

       <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <blockquote class="quote">
      “There is no favourable wind for the sailor who does not know where he is going.”
      <p class="author">Seneca</p>
    </blockquote>
    

    <p>
      Having a clear understanding of our objectives with the content strategy is fundamental to determining the rest of the steps in the strategic process. Which part of the conversion funnel do we want to work on? Do people know our brand/product? Does the audience consider it a purchase option? If they buy from us, do they come back? If they return, do we want them to recommend us?
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to set a clear and common objective for the entire content strategy on social media, although we may later have specific objectives for each campaign; these can never be defined without achieving the overall objective first, which sits above the funnel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each company or project, due to its nature or situation, will have more prominent objectives than others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The content we generate will be directed at users or clients at some point in their relationship with our project, and these objectives might include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Brand, Service, or Product Awareness</li>
      <li>Promoting an Event</li>
      <li>Registering for a Webinar</li>
      <li>Generating Leads</li>
      <li>Converting Customers</li>
      <li>Encouraging Cross-selling</li>
      <li>Building Loyalty</li>
      <li>Increasing NPS</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Activities and Types of Content</h3>
    <p>
      Once we have a clear objective, we must evaluate what types of content and related activities we need to deploy to help us achieve those objectives.
      The type of content we should create will differ if we do not have a recognised brand image compared to if people are already consuming our content regularly.
      The type of content should aim to satisfy the needs of our audiences at the phase of the funnel where we have anchored our objective.
    </p>

    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <blockquote class="quote">
      “Content is King, but distribution is queen and she wears the pants”
    </blockquote>
    <p class="author">John Steinberg, former president of Buzzfeed</p>

    <p>
      The correct selection of our target audience will dictate the channels we will use to distribute our content.
      Where are they currently consuming content? It is important to review this frequently, as audiences migrate from one platform to another or change their content consumption habits more often.
      Platforms usually have paid media solutions developed for brands to leverage the funnel stage they want to focus on.
      Evaluate those that are relevant at the time you distribute your content.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before creating content, you must have a dynamic plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Include paid media campaigns to enhance reach; relying solely on organic content distribution on social media is no longer effective.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no magic recipes; we must experiment, measure, and learn until we find what works.
    </p>

    <p>Main Distribution Channels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My Platform: It is always advisable to have a "digital base camp" that does not rely on third-party platforms.</li>
      <li>SEO.</li>
      <li>Social Media.</li>
      <li>Collaborations with third parties, including influencers and media outlets.</li>
      <li>Investment in paid campaigns across different social media platforms to promote our content and that of collaborators generating content around our brand.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Operation</h3>


  <p>It is clear that content must have a clear operational plan. It is not enough to just create and distribute it. A comprehensive operational process must be established. With clear editorial calendars and checkpoints, the governance of content must be correctly established.   
</p>
  <p>We need to clearly define the tasks involved in creating content for social media; there will be profiles more focused on copywriting and others more oriented towards graphic design or creating audiovisual pieces.   </p>
  <p>Everyone involved in the content strategy must clearly understand their roles and dependencies.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to establish content control points before publication to prevent a mistake from causing an online reputation crisis, and other points after content publication, to evaluate whether it is functioning correctly or generating opinions that diverge from the established objective.  </p>
  <p>A weekly content calendar should exist where upcoming content can be projected in advance.   </p>
  <p>Afterward, the content committee should hold a weekly meeting to evaluate the performance of the previous week’s content and, based on the conclusions, modify or approve the calendar for the following week.</p>
 

  <h3>Results Analysis </h3>

  <p>What cannot be measured does not exist, but we have good news: content on social media has numerous metrics that can be measured to analyse results. </p>
  <p>All content activities must be measured and compared with the expected business results (return vs. cost). </p>
  <p>For each objective, we should establish expected results for each activity with predefined KPIs that we will monitor.</p>
  <p>Each action will have different indicators, but ultimately they should result in:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Happier or more satisfied users or customers.   </li>
      <li>Increased revenue for the company.</li>
      <li>Reduced costs for the company.   </li>
    </ul>
<P>As with any process, refining the measurement process takes time, but a solid plan for analytics and user behaviour tracking should always be in place.</P>
<P>This will allow us to focus our resources effectively.</P>
<P>We should concentrate on measuring what we have set as our objectives, and nothing more. We must avoid paralysis by analysis; it is better to focus on the three to five fundamental metrics of your objective and disregard the rest if you do not wish to invest more time—it will not be necessary.  </P>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
      <p>
        In the end, it all comes down to finding the intersection between what interests my audience 
        (remember, we need to know them very well) and what we are experts in and can differentiate ourselves with.
