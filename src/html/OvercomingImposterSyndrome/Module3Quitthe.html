            <h2>Lesson 4: Module 3 Workbook & Journal </h2>

<h3>The Cognitive Triangle: A Sacred Mirror for Inner Awareness</h3>

<p>Imagine a soft triangle glowing gently at the center of your being — three sacred points held in balance: your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions. This is the Cognitive Triangle — a tender framework from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that invites us into compassionate self-inquiry and soulful healing.</p>

<p>In the holistic healing journey, we come to understand that every reaction, every choice, every emotion — even the ones we wish away — is simply a whisper from the self, asking to be seen with love.</p>

<h3>The Triangle Speaks:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Situation:</strong> A moment, memory, or trigger that stirs something in you.</li>
    <li><strong>Thoughts:</strong> The inner narratives, conscious or unconscious, that arise.</li>
    <li><strong>Feelings:</strong> The emotions your body holds and reflects.</li>
    <li><strong>Behaviors:</strong> The ways you respond — through action or avoidance.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we shift one point, the whole system begins to soften, recalibrate, and realign with our highest truth. There is no pressure to fix it all — only to bring light to one tender corner at a time.</p>

<h3>Soul Reflection: Mapping Your Triangle</h3>

<p>Take a sacred pause. Let your breath flow like a stream. Place your hand on your heart if it feels soothing. Then gently journal your reflections below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What recent moment or situation has activated something within you?</strong> (A conversation, rejection, a missed opportunity, a conflict, or something left undone.)</li>
    <li><strong>What inner dialogue unfolded as you sat with this moment?</strong> (Let the thoughts come freely. Even the raw ones. Let them be witnessed.)</li>
    <li><strong>What emotions stirred in your body and spirit as these thoughts took root?</strong> (Were you sad, ashamed, anxious, numb, overwhelmed?)</li>
    <li><strong>How did these feelings influence your actions or choices?</strong> (Did you withdraw, procrastinate, lash out, overcompensate, numb, or avoid?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Self-Sabotage: A Wound That Wants to Be Loved, Not Judged</h3>

<p>We often think of self-sabotage as failure. But darling, it’s not. Self-sabotage is your nervous system saying, “I don’t feel safe yet to expand.” It is a part of you — younger, frightened, protective — trying to keep you safe by holding you back.</p>

<p>But what once protected you may now be limiting you. This module is your invitation to gently unhook from that pattern and come home to your radiant potential.</p>

<h3>The Sacred Pathway to Healing Self-Sabotage</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose the Area Your Soul Longs to Heal. Is it your career, relationships, self-expression, creative voice, abundance, or body? Trust what calls to you.</p>

<p>“I often hold myself back when it comes to…” (complete the sentence)</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Name the Ways You Sabotage with Compassion. What does your self-sabotage look like here? Be lovingly honest. Common forms include: procrastination, perfectionism, people-pleasing, avoidance, harsh self-criticism, quitting before finishing, shrinking from visibility.</p>

<p>“When I feel vulnerable in this area, I tend to…”</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Recall a Recent Moment. Describe a time when this pattern surfaced. What happened? What did you do or not do? Invite the moment in — not as evidence of failure, but as a gateway to healing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Find the Triggers Beneath the Surface. Was it fear of failure? Fear of being judged? Of being seen? Of being too much — or not enough?</p>

<p>“This pattern usually gets activated when I…”</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Witness the Thought Loop. What story do you tell yourself when you fall into this pattern? It might sound like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“I’m going to mess this up.”</li>
    <li>“I’ll be rejected if I try.”</li>
    <li>“I don’t know enough.”</li>
    <li>“It’s safer to stay invisible.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Write down 2–3 core beliefs you carry here. Now ask gently: Are these really your truths, or were they inherited, conditioned, or wounded into you?</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Breathe Into the Emotions. What emotions lie beneath this pattern? Name them softly. Shame, fear, sadness, grief, inadequacy, loneliness — all are welcome. All deserve tending.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Trace the Root Wound. Is there a younger version of you who first felt this? Maybe a childhood moment of rejection, comparison, failure, or invisibility? Let her know she is safe now. You are here with her. You are re-parenting the wound with grace.</p>

<h3>Sacred Reframe: Choosing New, Nourishing Beliefs</h3>

<p>Let’s plant seeds of self-love and truth:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Instead of “I’m going to mess this up,” I choose to believe: “I can trust myself through the learning.”</li>
    <li>Instead of “I’m not enough,” I choose: “I am whole as I am. My worth is not up for debate.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Write down 3 new soul-anchored truths you are ready to affirm. Make them gentle. Loving. Rooted in the truth of who you are becoming.</p>

<h3>The Pattern Interrupt: A Portal to New Possibility</h3>

<p>This sacred tool from NLP allows you to pause and choose differently — in real time.</p>

<h4>How to Practice:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Name the old pattern (e.g., “I spiral into self-doubt when receiving feedback.”)</li>
    <li>Pick a sacred interrupt. Try:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Tap your heart while whispering, “I choose peace.”</li>
        <li>Light a candle.</li>
        <li>Place one hand on your womb and one on your heart.</li>
        <li>Take three long exhales and say, “I am safe.”</li>
    </ul>
    <li>When the trigger arises, pause. Interrupt it. Breathe. Ask: “What does the empowered version of me choose right now?”</li>
    <li>Respond with love. Even the smallest shift is holy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Loving Integration Plan</h3>

<p>Create a soft action plan to anchor this healing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What small, doable step can I take this week that affirms my worth?</li>
    <li>How can I honor my progress daily?</li>
    <li>What support system or resource (coach, friend, journal, ritual) can hold me as I grow?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closing Affirmations:</h3>

<p>Whisper them to yourself. Breathe them in. Feel them take root.</p>

<ul>
    <li>“I trust the timing of my becoming.”</li>
    <li>“My self-sabotage is not my identity — it’s a wound I am healing with love.”</li>
    <li>“I am safe to take up space.”</li>
    <li>“I release perfection and embrace my sacred unfolding.”</li>
    <li>“Every small step I take is a declaration of my worth.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Beloved one, this work is deep — and it is divine. Self-sabotage does not mean you are broken. It means a part of you once learned to survive through withdrawal, hesitation, or self-protection. Now, you are re-teaching yourself how to thrive.</p>

<p>Take your time. Rest often. Let your healing be soft. Let it be sacred.</p>
