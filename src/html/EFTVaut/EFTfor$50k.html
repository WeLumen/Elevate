            <h2>Lesson 5: EFT for $50k</h2>

<p>I want to begin by honoring the part of you that showed up for this practice — the part of you that dares to believe in more. More ease. More space. More freedom. More abundance.</p>

<p>Whether you’re here out of longing, necessity, hope, or curiosity — it all matters. You matter. And today, we’re not just calling in a number. We’re calling in a frequency — one of deserving, receptivity, safety, and embodied worth.</p>

<p>This is a sacred recalibration. One that gently dissolves the internal blocks, the inherited stories, and the ancestral fear around money… so your nervous system can actually feel safe receiving $50,000 and beyond.</p>

<h2>Anchoring the Body: Breath & Presence</h2>
<p>We begin with breath — the bridge between your body and your spirit.</p>

<p>Place one hand over your heart, and the other over your solar plexus — your center of personal power. Soften your shoulders. Unclench your jaw. Invite in stillness.</p>

<p>Let’s take three slow, nurturing breaths:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inhale through the nose...</strong> Feel the breath expand your chest, your belly, your back. Hold for 3… 2… 1… Exhale softly through the mouth.</li>
  <li><strong>Inhale abundance, possibility, openness.</strong> Hold for 3… 2… 1… Exhale doubt, constriction, shame.</li>
  <li><strong>One more deep breath in…</strong> Imagine it carrying light into every cell of your body. Hold… and gently exhale.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are here. You are safe. You are worthy.</p>

<h2>Tapping Practice: Beginning with the Karate Chop Point</h2>
<p>Tap gently on the side of your hand (karate chop point) while repeating after me — or simply absorb the energy of the words:</p>

<p>
Even though I don’t see $50,000 in my bank account right now…<br>
And part of me feels unworthy or unsure if I ever will…<br>
I love and accept myself exactly as I am.<br><br>

Even though I desire this money deeply,<br>
a part of me is afraid of what it would mean to actually have it.<br>
I honor that fear with compassion.<br>
And I am open to healing it — gently, lovingly, at my own pace.<br><br>

Even though I’ve carried limiting beliefs about money for years…<br>
I choose to believe that another way is possible.<br>
I’m ready to feel safe with abundance.<br>
I’m ready to receive.
</p>

<h2>Tapping Through the Points: Honoring the Resistance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong> There’s a part of me that doubts this is possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> A part of me says, “It’s too much… who am I to ask for that?”</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> Maybe I learned that money is hard to earn… or dangerous to want.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> I carry old stories — family beliefs, societal rules, ancestral wounds.</li>
  <li><strong>Chin Point:</strong> I’ve been taught to shrink. To settle. To struggle.</li>
  <li><strong>Collarbone Point:</strong> I feel the tension in my body when I think about having that much money.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> I’m afraid I’ll lose it. Or that it will change me.</li>
  <li><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> What if it’s safe to want this? What if it’s sacred to allow this?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tapping Into Worthiness & Receiving</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong> I am ready to release the fear that says I’m not enough.</li>
  <li><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> I am not here to repeat old scarcity cycles.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> I am ready to feel safe in my body while receiving more.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> This money is a resource — not a threat.</li>
  <li><strong>Chin Point:</strong> It will support my healing, my vision, my joy.</li>
  <li><strong>Collarbone Point:</strong> I don’t have to know how. I just have to say yes.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> Yes to allowing. Yes to trusting. Yes to receiving with grace.</li>
  <li><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I am becoming the version of me who feels free around money.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tapping into Abundance Consciousness</h2>
<p>$50,000 is not just a number. It’s a doorway. Into expansion. Into deeper service. Into resourced rest. Into pleasure without guilt.</p>

<p>I am open to receiving this amount — and more — in ways that feel ethical, aligned, and joyful.</p>

<p>I let go of the pressure to earn my worth. I let go of the shame I’ve carried. I let go of the fear of being seen with wealth.</p>

<p>I choose wealth with integrity. I choose wealth as a healer. I choose wealth as a woman reclaiming her power.</p>

<h2>Sacred Affirmations of Alignment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am safe to receive.</li>
  <li>I am a channel for divine abundance.</li>
  <li>I allow money to flow to me, through me, and around me with love.</li>
  <li>I am grounded in my values and supported by the universe.</li>
  <li>I am no longer available for struggle as my baseline.</li>
  <li>I say yes to ease. Yes to expansion. Yes to $50,000 and beyond.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing the Session</h2>
<p>Place your hands back over your heart and belly. Let yourself pause. Feel. Integrate.</p>

<p>Take a final slow breath in… Hold… Exhale softly, fully, completely.</p>

<p>Check in with yourself now. How does your body feel? What sensations are present? If resistance was a 10 before, where is it now?</p>

<p>There’s no rush to “fix” anything — your healing unfolds in perfect timing.</p>

<p>Come back to this practice anytime your fear of lack resurfaces. Let this be your ritual of remembrance: that you were born worthy of beauty, softness, and overflowing support.</p>

<h2>Final Blessing</h2>
<p>Beloved,<br>
You are not asking for too much.<br>
You are remembering that you are already enough.</p>

<p>Let this be the season where you stop trying to earn your worth — and start allowing it to support you.</p>

<p>You are resourced.<br>
You are radiant.<br>
You are ready.</p>

<p>And $50,000 is just the beginning.</p>
