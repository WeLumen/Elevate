            <h2>Lesson 1: Release Not Feeling Good</h2>

            <p>Welcome, my love. I’m so grateful that you’re here today, showing up for yourself in this sacred moment, and it’s truly an honor to guide you through this transformative and healing practice of Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also lovingly known as Tapping.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to gently release the heavy emotional burdens tied to the belief that you are "not good enough." This is a story many of us carry, often without even realizing how deeply it has woven itself into our sense of self. And this belief—this feeling of not being enough—can show up in so many ways: in our relationships, our work, our health, and in how we speak to and about ourselves.</p>

<p>This feeling of “I’m not good enough” can sit deep in your body, in the places where we hold tension: your heart space, your shoulders, your jaw, even your gut. Sometimes, we don’t even realize how tightly we hold it until we pause to give ourselves the space to feel. Tapping is a powerful way to release these old emotional patterns, gently unlocking the energy that is stuck in your system.</p>

<p>In EFT, we use the tips of our fingers to tap along certain acupressure points on the body. These points help release emotional energy, much like acupuncture, but without the use of needles. When we tap on these points while repeating words, we create a safe space for our emotions to move and shift. The process is gentle, loving, and deeply healing.</p>

<p>As we begin today, I invite you to take a deep breath and tune into the words “I’m not good enough.”</p>

<p>How do they feel in your body?<br>
Where do you feel them most strongly?<br>
It could be in your chest, your throat, your stomach, or maybe even in your mind.<br>
Just notice. No judgment. Give yourself the gift of awareness.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Tuning Into the Emotion</h2>

<p>Grab a piece of paper and draw a little scale from -10 to +10.<br>
Think about the phrase, “I’m not good enough.” When you say or think this, where do you land on that scale?<br>
Maybe it’s a 7, maybe it’s a 3, or maybe it’s a 10.<br>
Just take a moment to feel into it. Write that number down.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Beginning the Tapping Process</h2>

<p>Now, we’ll begin with the Karate Chop point (the fleshy side of your hand).<br>
Start tapping gently with the tips of your fingers and repeat after me, softly, with loving presence.</p>

<h3>Karate Chop Point</h3>

<p>Even though I feel like I’m not good enough, I deeply and completely love and accept myself.<br>
Even though I’ve carried this belief that I’m not good enough for as long as I can remember, I choose to be gentle with myself now.<br>
Even though I sometimes feel like I’ll never measure up, I accept myself where I am today.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head</h3>

<p>I’m not good enough.<br>
I’ve felt this way for so long.<br>
There’s this voice that tells me I’m not enough…<br>
And I believe it sometimes.</p>

<h3>Eyebrow</h3>

<p>I feel this belief deep inside me.<br>
It’s hard to shake.<br>
I’ve tried to push it away, but it keeps coming back.<br>
“I’m not good enough.”<br>
These words feel so heavy.</p>

<h3>Side of the Eye</h3>

<p>It’s exhausting, always feeling like I have to prove myself.<br>
Always feeling like I’m falling short.<br>
I’ve tried so hard to be good enough.<br>
But it never feels like enough.</p>

<h3>Under the Eye</h3>

<p>I feel this pressure inside my chest.<br>
Like I’m carrying this weight, this belief that I’m just not good enough.<br>
I’ve let this story define me for so long.<br>
I’ve believed that I have to be perfect to be loved.</p>

<h3>Under the Nose</h3>

<p>But it’s so hard to keep up with this pressure.<br>
I feel so small sometimes, like I’m not enough.<br>
I feel like I’m always trying to be someone I’m not.</p>

<h3>Chin</h3>

<p>I’ve spent so much time feeling like I’m not enough.<br>
Like I have to do more, be more, show more.<br>
I’ve carried this belief with me for years.<br>
But I’m ready to release it.</p>

<h3>Collarbone</h3>

<p>It’s safe to let go of this belief.<br>
It’s safe to be imperfect.<br>
It’s safe to make mistakes and still be worthy of love.<br>
It’s okay to not be perfect.</p>

<h3>Under the Arm</h3>

<p>I am ready to release the weight of “I’m not good enough.”<br>
I am ready to release the pressure to be someone else.<br>
I am ready to release the need to prove myself.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head</h3>

<p>I’m beginning to believe that I am enough, just as I am.<br>
I am enough, exactly as I am.<br>
I am worthy of love, and I don’t need to prove my worth.<br>
I choose to release the belief that I’m not good enough.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Replacing with Love and Self-Acceptance</h2>

<p>Now, let’s shift the energy and bring in some new beliefs.<br>
Let’s tap into the idea that you are already enough, just as you are.<br>
Take a deep breath, and let's tap into these healing affirmations.</p>

<h3>Karate Chop Point</h3>

<p>Even though I’ve felt like I’m not good enough, I choose to believe I am worthy, just as I am.<br>
Even though I’ve carried this belief for so long, I am open to releasing it now.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head</h3>

<p>I am enough.<br>
I am worthy.<br>
I don’t need to prove anything.<br>
I am enough, just as I am.</p>

<h3>Eyebrow</h3>

<p>I am worthy of love and kindness.<br>
I am worthy of receiving.<br>
I am enough, even without perfection.</p>

<h3>Side of the Eye</h3>

<p>I choose to believe in my worth.<br>
I am worthy of love and abundance, exactly as I am.<br>
I am learning to accept myself.</p>

<h3>Under the Eye</h3>

<p>I release the need to prove myself.<br>
I release the fear of not being enough.<br>
I am worthy of all the good that is coming my way.</p>

<h3>Under the Nose</h3>

<p>I choose to love and accept myself.<br>
I am enough, just as I am.<br>
I choose to show up as my true, authentic self.</p>

<h3>Chin</h3>

<p>I am releasing the story of “not enough.”<br>
I am rewriting my story with love and acceptance.</p>

<h3>Collarbone</h3>

<p>I trust that I am worthy, just as I am.<br>
I trust that I am enough.</p>

<h3>Under the Arm</h3>

<p>I am deserving of love, success, and happiness.<br>
I am worthy of all the good things that life has to offer.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head</h3>

<p>I choose to fully accept myself.<br>
I am enough, exactly as I am.<br>
I am worthy of all the love, kindness, and abundance in the world.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check-In and Reflection</h2>

<p>Now, take a deep breath in…<br>
And let it go slowly.</p>

<p>How are you feeling, love?<br>
Check in with the scale again.<br>
Where do you feel now when you think of “I’m not good enough”?<br>
Have you shifted? Has that number gone down? Even if it’s just a little, that’s progress.</p>

<p>This process may take time, and that’s okay.<br>
You can always come back to this practice, tap on it as often as you need, and watch the charge around these old beliefs slowly melt away.</p>

<p>Remember, you are enough. Always have been.<br>
You are deserving of love, acceptance, and everything that is good.<br>
You are worthy of being seen, heard, and honored for who you truly are.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me in this sacred space today.<br>
You are doing beautiful work.<br>
I’m so proud of you for showing up for yourself.<br>
Take care of your heart, and know that you are always worthy, just as you are.</p>

<p><em>With love and compassion,</em></p>
