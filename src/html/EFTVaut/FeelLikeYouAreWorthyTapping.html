            <h2>Lesson 2: Feel Like You Are Worthy Tapping</h2>

            <p>Welcome, dear one. In this moment, we are inviting healing and transformation to unfold as we gently work through one of the most profound emotional wounds that many of us carry—the feeling of not being worthy. This belief can be so deeply ingrained that we often don’t even realize how it quietly shapes our lives and our decisions. It may be more subtle than the feeling of “not good enough,” but it is just as powerful, sometimes even more so.</p>

<p>Today, I want to hold space for you to release this heavy burden. I want you to feel seen, to feel loved, and most importantly, to feel worthy—just as you are. This is your invitation to soften, to heal, and to reclaim your inherent worthiness.</p>

<p>Before we begin, I invite you to ground yourself. Breathe deeply… inhale slowly, and exhale even more slowly. Allow your breath to guide you back to the present moment. Feel the weight of your body in the seat beneath you, the support of the earth beneath your feet. You are held. You are safe.</p>

<p>If you have a pen and paper nearby, please take it out. There’s power in writing and reflecting, and I encourage you to draw a simple scale. Mark a -10 on the left, a +10 on the right, and a 0 in the center. On this scale, please write down a number that reflects how strongly you feel the weight of unworthiness right now. Perhaps it’s a deep, almost invisible ache in your heart, or perhaps it feels like a knot in your stomach. Maybe it’s a vague sense that you don’t truly belong. Write down the number that most closely represents how you’re feeling in this moment.</p>

<p>This scale will be our reference point. By the end of this practice, we will witness how much lighter and freer you feel. Often, we forget the intensity of the emotions we hold, so writing this down will help us track the shift.</p>

<p>Now, as you settle into this moment, take a deep breath in. Feel your body relax and open. Trust that, in this space, we’re going to gently release this old belief. We’re going to speak to that part of you that feels unworthy, the part that holds onto shame, guilt, or the quiet thought that you don’t deserve.</p>

<p>Know that you are not alone. These feelings live in so many of us, and yet, together, we can transform them.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), or tapping. EFT works with the body’s energy meridians—paths of energy that run throughout our bodies, similar to the channels in acupuncture. When we tap on these points, we help release the blocks that store emotional pain and tension, allowing the nervous system to calm and restore balance.</p>

<p>This practice might bring up emotions, and that’s perfectly okay. In fact, it’s a sign that the energy is shifting. If you find tears welling up or if you feel a release, allow yourself to feel. It’s all part of the process.</p>

<p><strong>Karate Chop Point (Side of the Hand):</strong><br>
Even though I’ve carried this belief, this feeling that I’m not worthy, I choose to love and accept myself anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong><br>
Not worthy.</p>

<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong><br>
I don’t feel worthy.</p>

<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong><br>
I’ve never felt truly worthy…</p>

<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong><br>
For as long as I can remember, this belief has been here.</p>

<p><strong>Chin:</strong><br>
I’m not good enough. I’m not deserving.</p>

<p><strong>Collarbone:</strong><br>
I can feel the weight of this belief in my body, heavy on my heart, tight in my chest.</p>

<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong><br>
It makes me feel unseen, small, and so sad.</p>

<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong><br>
But I’m ready to let go. I’m ready to feel something different.</p>

<p>Back to the Karate Chop Point:<br>
Even though I’ve carried this belief, this heavy feeling of unworthiness, I choose to love and accept myself anyway. Even if it’s hard to believe right now, I say it with compassion and kindness.</p>

<p><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong><br>
I am so tired of carrying this heaviness.</p>

<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong><br>
It’s been with me for so long.</p>

<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong><br>
Even though I still feel it, I choose to be gentle with myself.</p>

<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong><br>
I love and accept myself, even in my imperfection.</p>

<p><strong>Chin:</strong><br>
I love and accept myself, even when I don’t feel like I belong.</p>

<p><strong>Collarbone:</strong><br>
I am allowed to be enough, just as I am, right here, right now.</p>

<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong><br>
I am learning to accept myself, all of me—flaws, scars, and all.</p>

<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong><br>
Even with all my imperfections, I am worthy of love and acceptance.</p>

<p>Now, let’s take a few moments to breathe deeply and slowly. Allow your body to soften. Trust that the energy is moving and shifting within you. Keep tapping, keep breathing, and keep opening.</p>

<p>As we move forward, repeat these affirmations gently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am learning to love myself.</li>
  <li>I am learning to accept myself.</li>
  <li>I am allowed to feel good, to feel joy, to feel peace.</li>
  <li>I am beginning to feel safe in my own skin.</li>
  <li>I deserve to feel good.</li>
  <li>I deserve to be loved—by me.</li>
  <li>I deserve to be seen—by me.</li>
  <li>I deserve to be held—by me.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you repeat these words, notice how your body feels. Perhaps the tension begins to release from your shoulders, or your breath deepens. Maybe your heart feels a little more expansive, a little more open. Emotions might arise, and that’s okay—this is a part of the process of healing.</p>

<p>Now, check in with yourself. Look at the number you wrote earlier on the scale. How has it shifted? Does the weight of the words “I am not worthy” feel lighter? Do they feel less true, less charged?</p>

<p>If you still feel the intensity of those emotions, please know that’s perfectly normal. Healing isn’t linear, and it takes time. You are in this for the long haul, and every step you take is a step closer to your true self—your worthy, beautiful, deserving self.</p>

<p>Remember, this practice can be repeated as often as you need. There’s no rush. Your healing journey is unique to you, and each time you tap, you’re clearing space for more love, more acceptance, and more peace.</p>

<p>Thank you for showing up for yourself today. You have taken a powerful step toward healing, and that is something to be proud of. You are worthy. You are enough. You always have been.</p>

<p>May you continue to feel more whole, more authentic, and more you with each breath you take.</p>

<p>With deep love and gratitude,</p>

<p>Your EFT Practitioner and Holistic Guide</p>
