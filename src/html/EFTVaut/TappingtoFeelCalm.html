            <h2>Lesson 1: Tapping to Feel Calm</h2>

            <p><strong>A Gentle, Grounding Practice for Anxiety and Overwhelm</strong></p>

<p>Welcome, dear one. I’m so glad you’ve come here today, seeking a way to bring peace and calm into your body, mind, and heart. My name is [Therapist Name], and I’ll be guiding you through this gentle tapping practice that you can return to anytime you’re feeling anxious, overwhelmed, or just a little unsettled.</p>

<p>Life can be overwhelming at times — so much is asked of us, and it’s easy to forget the importance of pausing, breathing, and coming back to our center. This tapping practice is like a soft reset, a way to ground yourself, release tension, and return to a place of safety and calm. It’s an invitation to lovingly soothe your nervous system and reconnect with the inner peace that already resides within you.</p>

<p>Before we begin, let’s take a moment to check in with yourself. How are you feeling right now? Ask yourself: On a scale of 1 to 10, how strong is the anxiety or overwhelm that I’m feeling? Where is it showing up in your body? Is it in your chest? In your stomach? In your throat? Or maybe it feels like a buzzing, restless energy throughout your whole body?</p>

<p>There’s no judgment here. No “right” or “wrong” way to feel. Just be gentle with yourself and notice where you are. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, release any tension or stress you might be holding onto.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Grounding and Preparing for Tapping</h2>

<p>Now that we have a sense of how you’re feeling, let’s begin the practice. We’ll start at the Karate Chop point on the side of your hand, the fleshy part below your pinky. You can use two or three fingers, whatever feels most natural to you. Begin tapping gently, slowly, with intention. As you tap, repeat these words softly, allowing them to sink into your body:</p>

<h2>Step 2: Tapping Sequence</h2>

<h3>Karate Chop Point (Side of Hand):</h3>
<p>Even though I feel anxious and overwhelmed right now, I deeply love and accept myself. Even though I’m feeling all this tension and uncertainty, I choose to honor myself in this moment. Even though my mind is racing and my body is tight, I choose to love myself exactly as I am.</p>

<p>Now, move to the Eyebrow point, right where your brow begins. Take a moment to feel into your body. If there’s tension or discomfort, just notice it, without judgment. We’re simply creating space for this energy to shift.</p>

<h3>Eyebrow Point:</h3>
<p>Even though I feel anxious, I choose to be present with myself. Even though I feel overwhelmed, I choose to be gentle with myself. Even though I feel like everything is too much, I give myself permission to take a deep breath.</p>

<h3>Side of the Eye:</h3>
<p>Even though there’s so much happening in my mind right now, I honor my need for calm. Even though I feel scattered, I give myself the gift of grounding and stillness. Even though I’m afraid of what might happen next, I choose to trust that I am safe right here, right now.</p>

<h3>Under the Eye:</h3>
<p>Even though I feel this tightness in my chest, I choose to release it. Even though my body feels heavy or tense, I know I can soften. Even though this feeling feels uncomfortable, I am allowing it to flow through me.</p>

<h3>Under the Nose:</h3>
<p>Even though I feel disconnected from peace, I remember that calm is always available to me. Even though I’m unsure of what will happen next, I trust that I can handle whatever comes. Even though I’m afraid of what’s next, I trust that I have everything I need inside me to navigate this moment.</p>

<h3>Chin (Crease of Chin):</h3>
<p>Even though I feel on edge, I acknowledge my feelings and allow them to exist. Even though I feel unsettled and unsure, I choose to breathe through this. Even though I feel anxious, I choose to relax and soften my body.</p>

<h3>Collarbone (Just below the collarbone):</h3>
<p>Even though I feel overwhelmed, I am choosing to slow down. Even though I am caught up in fear, I gently release that fear now. Even though I feel like I have to control everything, I trust the flow of life and my ability to adapt.</p>

<h3>Under the Arm (A hand-width below the armpit):</h3>
<p>Even though I feel tense and uncertain, I know that I can release this. Even though I feel like there’s too much happening, I choose to come back to this moment. Even though I feel overwhelmed, I trust that I am supported by the love I give myself.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head (Crown Point):</h3>
<p>Even though I feel all this anxiety, I choose to relax. Even though I feel like I’m carrying a heavy load, I choose to release it now. Even though I feel overwhelmed, I know I am safe, I am whole, and I am enough.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Restoring Calm</h2>
<p>Take a deep breath in now, and as you exhale, imagine releasing all that tension you’ve just been holding onto. With each breath, imagine your body softening, your heart settling, your mind calming. If you’ve been feeling anxious or overwhelmed, notice if the energy has shifted at all. Maybe the intensity has lessened. Maybe you feel a little lighter, or your breath feels easier.</p>

<p>If you still feel some charge, that’s okay. Go back through the points again and repeat the tapping phrases, this time focusing on the calmness you want to bring into your body.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Calming Affirmations</h2>
<p>Let’s now begin to replace the old anxiety with new, calming energy. Move back to the Karate Chop point and repeat with me:</p>

<h3>Karate Chop Point:</h3>
<p>Even though I’ve been feeling anxious and overwhelmed, I choose to feel calm now. Even though I’ve been holding onto this tension, I am allowing myself to relax. Even though I’ve been scared, I trust that I am safe and calm.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head:</h3>
<p>I am safe right now. I am grounded in this moment. I am breathing deeply and calmly. I trust that I can handle whatever comes my way.</p>

<h3>Eyebrow Point:</h3>
<p>I choose peace over anxiety. I choose calm over chaos. I choose to trust that I am supported.</p>

<h3>Side of the Eye:</h3>
<p>I am allowed to take a break. I am allowed to pause and breathe. I am safe in this moment.</p>

<h3>Under the Eye:</h3>
<p>I release tension from my body, and I feel calm. I choose to feel peaceful and centered. I trust that everything will work out as it’s meant to.</p>

<h3>Under the Nose:</h3>
<p>I am grounded in this moment, and I feel safe. I am centered and relaxed. I trust my body’s ability to heal and release.</p>

<h3>Chin:</h3>
<p>I trust that I am supported in all that I do. I allow myself to rest in the calmness of this moment. I am letting go of fear, and I’m inviting peace.</p>

<h3>Collarbone:</h3>
<p>I trust that I am safe. I trust in the quiet stillness within me. I choose to release all tension and embrace calm.</p>

<h3>Under the Arm:</h3>
<p>I trust in my ability to feel safe. I choose to stay grounded in peace. I trust my body’s wisdom to bring me back to calm.</p>

<h3>Top of the Head:</h3>
<p>I am safe, I am calm, and I am at peace. I am breathing deeply and with ease. I am letting go of the stress and inviting calmness in.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Final Check-In</h2>
<p>Take a deep breath in through your nose, and let it go slowly. Notice how you’re feeling now. Where are you on that scale of 1 to 10? Has the feeling of anxiety or overwhelm shifted? Maybe the intensity has reduced, or perhaps you feel a sense of peace starting to replace the tension. Whatever you’re feeling is perfectly okay. This process is all about being present with yourself, and it’s not about perfection — it’s about giving yourself the gift of healing, compassion, and calm.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>You’ve done beautiful work today. You’ve taken a pause to nurture yourself, to ground yourself, and to return to your center. This is a powerful step towards healing and self-care. Remember, you can return to this tapping practice whenever you need to calm your nervous system, release stress, or simply reconnect with your sense of inner peace.</p>

<p>Thank you for showing up for yourself today. You are safe. You are calm. And you are enough.</p>

<p>With deep love and care,</p>
