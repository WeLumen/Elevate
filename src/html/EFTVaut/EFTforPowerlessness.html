            <h2>Lesson 3: EFT for Powerlessness</h2>

<p>If you’re reading this, it may be because something inside you has been feeling tender… perhaps raw, tired, or unsure of how to keep moving forward. Maybe you’ve been carrying a weight you don’t quite know how to put down — a quiet ache of powerlessness, like you’ve lost your voice, your footing, or your sense of self.</p>

<p>Please know: there is nothing wrong with you. Powerlessness is not a flaw. It is a signal — a sacred whisper from within that longs to be met with love.</p>

<p>As a holistic therapist and EFT practitioner, I want to remind you that these feelings aren’t your identity. They’re echoes — often rooted in unmet needs, unresolved pain, or inherited patterns that once helped you survive but no longer serve your soul’s truth.</p>

<p>And the good news? You can transmute this. Gently. Tenderly. At your own pace.</p>

<p>Together, we’ll journey inward — not to fix you, but to remember you. To return to your center. To reclaim the inner power that has always lived inside you — perhaps hidden, perhaps quiet, but never lost.</p>

<h2>Grounding Into the Body</h2>

<p>Let’s begin by coming home to the body — your first and truest sanctuary.</p>

<p>Place one hand over your heart, and the other over your belly if it feels good to do so. Close your eyes, or soften your gaze.</p>

<p>Take a slow, nourishing breath in through your nose…<br>
Hold it for 3… 2… 1…<br>
Exhale gently through the mouth.</p>

<p>Again, inhale peace…<br>
Hold for 3… 2… 1…<br>
Exhale tension, doubt, fear.</p>

<p>One more breath. This time, imagine breathing in yourself — your truth, your light.<br>
Hold for 3… 2… 1…<br>
Exhale anything that no longer belongs.</p>

<p>You are safe here. Your body is listening. And your healing begins now.</p>

<h2>EFT Tapping Practice: Releasing Powerlessness</h2>

<h3>Karate Chop Point (Side of the Hand)</h3>

<p>Repeat gently after me — aloud or silently in your heart:</p>

<p>Even though I feel powerless right now… I deeply and completely love and accept myself.<br>
Even though I feel like I’ve lost control, like I don’t know the way… I hold myself with love and grace.<br>
Even though I sometimes feel like I don’t matter… I honor that pain — and I honor the part of me that longs to rise.</p>

<h3>Tapping Through the Points</h3>

<p><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong> I feel so small right now… like nothing I do will make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> I’ve tried to be strong… but I feel like I’m carrying too much.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> I feel invisible sometimes… like no one really sees me.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> I’m afraid I’ll keep failing… that I’ll never fully become who I know I’m meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>Chin Point:</strong> There’s a deep fear… that I’m not enough.</p>
<p><strong>Collarbone Point:</strong> Maybe I internalized someone else’s voice… A parent, a teacher, a partner — someone who made me question my worth.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> I’ve been holding this for so long… These stories… these wounds… these burdens that were never mine to carry.</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I am so ready to release this weight.</p>

<h2>Tapping Into Healing & Reclamation</h2>

<p><strong>Eyebrow Point:</strong> I am not broken. I am becoming.</p>
<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> I am not powerless — I am healing, layer by layer.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> I am allowed to take up space. I am allowed to change.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> There is strength in my softness.</p>
<p><strong>Chin Point:</strong> My power is not loud or forceful. It is steady. Gentle. Sacred.</p>
<p><strong>Collarbone Point:</strong> I am remembering who I truly am.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> I choose to believe in myself — even if it’s just a whisper right now.</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I am reclaiming my voice, my worth, my power.</p>

<h2>Empowering Integration: Affirmations for the Soul</h2>

<p>I was never meant to stay small.<br>
I am here to grow — to rise — to bloom.<br>
I choose to step forward, even when I feel afraid.<br>
I choose to love myself through every phase of becoming.<br>
I trust my intuition.<br>
I trust my timing.<br>
I trust my strength — even when it trembles.<br>
I am no longer available for stories that keep me stuck.<br>
I am a powerful woman with a sacred, sovereign light.<br>
And I will not dim it for anyone.<br>
I am becoming all of who I came here to be.</p>

<h2>Closing the Practice</h2>

<p>Place your hands over your heart again.</p>

<p>Breathe in deeply…<br>
Hold…<br>
Exhale gently.</p>

<p>Ask yourself — with kindness, not judgment:<br>
“If my feeling of powerlessness was a 10 before, where is it now?”</p>

<p>Let whatever arises be enough.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a 7. Maybe it’s a 3. Maybe there are tears — or maybe just stillness. All of it is welcome. All of it is healing.</p>

<p>Let this be a space you return to whenever the world feels too heavy.</p>

<p>You are not behind.<br>
You are not weak.<br>
You are awakening.<br>
And even when it feels messy — that, too, is part of the process.</p>

<p>I see your courage. I honor your healing. And I trust in your power, even when you can’t quite feel it yet.</p>

<p>You are not alone, dear one. You are a radiant, powerful being — and you are rising.</p>

<p><em>With love, always.<br>
— Your Inner Guide & Gentle Mirror</em></p>
