            <h2>Lesson 4: EFT for People Pleasing</h2>

            <p>I’m truly honored you’re here—choosing to pause, to turn inward, and to hold space for the part of you that’s been working so hard to be everything for everyone… often at the cost of your own truth.</p>

<p>This session is a loving invitation to begin releasing the emotional layers behind people-pleasing—a survival strategy that may have once protected you, but is now asking to be witnessed, honored, and gently released.</p>

<h2>Let’s begin by anchoring into your body</h2>
<p>Place one hand softly over your heart, and if it feels safe, allow your eyes to close. Let this moment be just for you—no performance, no pressure.</p>

<p>Take a deep, nourishing breath in… And as you exhale, let your shoulders melt away from your ears.</p>

<p>Let’s breathe together now, slowly and consciously—three full, loving cycles.</p>

<p>Inhale… Hold for 3… 2… 1… Exhale… and soften.</p>
<p>Again, breathing in gently… Hold… Exhale… let go of what’s not yours to carry.</p>
<p>One more breath—this one into your belly. Hold gently… And exhale fully and completely.</p>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<h2>Check-in</h2>
<p>Before we begin tapping, take a moment to check in with yourself. On a scale of 1 to 10, how activated or emotionally hooked into people-pleasing are you today?</p>

<p>There’s no right or wrong answer—just gentle awareness.</p>
<p>Notice if you’ve been over-extending… hiding parts of yourself… prioritizing others’ comfort over your own truth.</p>

<p>It’s okay. So many of us developed this pattern early in life—as a way to be loved, to stay safe, to avoid conflict. But you are allowed to outgrow it. You are allowed to take up space, exactly as you are.</p>

<h2>Let’s begin tapping</h2>
<p>We’ll start at the karate chop point, gently tapping on the side of your hand. If it feels right, repeat after me—either out loud or in a whisper. The vibration of your voice is powerful medicine.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Karate Chop Point:</strong> Even though I feel scared to disappoint others… I deeply and completely love and accept myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Eyebrow:</strong> Even though I’m afraid to speak my truth… I choose to love and accept all of me.</li>
  <li><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> Even though I often feel like a burden… I am worthy of love just as I am.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> Even though I try to hold everything together for everyone… I offer myself grace and gentleness.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> Even though I learned to abandon my needs to keep the peace… I am safe to return to myself now.</li>
  <li><strong>Chin:</strong> Even though I feel I must be perfect to be accepted… I am worthy in my realness and my messiness.</li>
  <li><strong>Collarbone:</strong> Even though I’m afraid to stop people-pleasing… I am learning to trust that I can be loved for who I am.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> Even though I fear I’m not enough on my own… I am reconnecting with my wholeness.</li>
  <li><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> Even though I sometimes silence myself to avoid conflict… I now choose to honor my voice and my needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a breath with me here. Inhale… And exhale gently.</p>

<h2>Let’s keep tapping, inviting in the new story</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eyebrow:</strong> What if it’s safe to let go of this old pattern?</li>
  <li><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> What if I can be loved without overgiving?</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> Maybe I don’t have to earn love anymore…</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> Maybe I was never meant to carry everyone’s emotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Chin:</strong> I am allowed to disappoint people—and still be worthy.</li>
  <li><strong>Collarbone:</strong> I am allowed to say no—and still be good.</li>
  <li><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> I am allowed to be real—and still be loved.</li>
  <li><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I belong to myself now. And that is enough.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing affirmations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Even though it still feels scary to put myself first… I am learning to trust my inner voice.</li>
  <li>Even though I once thought love had to be earned through sacrifice… I now know that my presence is enough.</li>
  <li>Even though I’ve been afraid to stop performing… I am safe to be fully, beautifully me.</li>
  <li>Even though I still catch myself people-pleasing… I meet myself with compassion, not shame.</li>
  <li>Even though it may take time to fully unlearn this… I am worthy of love every step of the way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take one more breath with me. Inhale… And exhale… soft and slow.</p>

<h2>Check-in again</h2>
<p>On that same scale of 1 to 10—where are you now? What shifted? What softened?</p>

<p>Whatever you're feeling is welcome. You might feel tender, or lighter, or simply more aware. All of it is valid.</p>

<p>This is deep work. These patterns can take time to untangle—but every time you return to yourself, every time you pause and tap and listen—you’re healing.</p>

<p>You’re not selfish for wanting boundaries. You’re not unkind for saying no. You’re not broken for needing rest.</p>
<p>You are human. You are sacred. You are enough.</p>

<p>Drink some water. Journal if it feels right. Cry if it comes. And know—this practice is here for you anytime.</p>

<p>If you’d like more support on this journey, I’d be honored to walk with you. You don’t have to do it alone.</p>

<p>Thank you for showing up with such courage and tenderness. You’re doing beautifully.</p>

<p><em>With love, always—<br>I'll see you in the next session, sweet soul.</em></p>
