            <h2>Lesson 1:  Releasing Fear wit EFT</h2>

            <p>Dearest one, I’m so grateful to be here with you today, guiding you through a process that can bring you closer to peace, clarity, and a sense of freedom from the fear that has long held space in your body and mind. Fear, while a natural and often protective response, can sometimes be a hidden, silent force driving many of our anxious thoughts, our worries, and the overwhelming stress we feel. The presence of fear doesn’t just sit in the conscious mind, but it often settles deep into the body—manifesting as tension, restlessness, or even exhaustion.</p>

<p>Today, we’re going to lovingly tend to this fear. We’re going to bring awareness to it, meet it with compassion, and use Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) to gently release it. The beauty of EFT is that it combines the power of physical touch with the calming effects of words and intention. As we tap on various points of your body, you will activate your body’s energy system in a way that helps to release pent-up emotions, relax your nervous system, and create space for healing.</p>

<p>So, let’s begin with some awareness. Take a moment to check in with yourself, gently.</p>

<p>I invite you to fill in the blank in this sentence:</p>

<p>“When I get really scared, I ______.”</p>

<p>What comes up for you? Do you retreat? Freeze? Try to control everything around you? Or perhaps you distract yourself, pretending it’s not there? There’s no right or wrong here—only what your body and mind are doing to protect you. In these moments, fear often triggers these protective responses, and when we make space to notice and gently release them, we step into deeper self-awareness and healing.</p>

<p>You are not alone in this. Fear is a common experience. Yet, we are going to invite you to step beyond it, to let go of what no longer serves you, and to make room for ease, comfort, and safety. I promise you, you have the strength within you to face this fear and release it.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment together to breathe deeply.</p>

<p>Close your eyes if that feels comfortable for you. Place a hand gently on your heart, and take a long, slow breath in. Breathe in deeply, feeling your belly expand. And now, as you exhale, let go of any tension, any fear, any resistance. Feel your body soften with each breath.</p>

<p>Now, ask yourself softly:</p>

<p>“What is it that I truly desire, beyond this fear? Beyond these stories I’ve been telling myself?”</p>

<p>What do you long for, deep within? What are your dreams, your aspirations, beyond the limiting stories that fear has whispered to you for so long? You are allowed to want what you want. You are allowed to feel everything you feel, and in this moment, you are invited to be brave enough to lean into that truth. There is immense strength in this kind of softness and vulnerability.</p>

<p>With that awareness, let’s move into our EFT practice. This tapping journey is one that will help you release tension, soothe your nervous system, and open the door to more peace and calm.</p>

<p>Take your hand, and begin tapping gently with the fingertips of one hand just below the pinky finger of your opposite hand—right at the side, similar to a karate chop. It’s the space on the side of your hand. As you tap, you can repeat these words after me or simply let the words land softly in your heart:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Even though I feel this fear in my body, I choose to relax now.”</li>
  <li>“Even though I am holding so much, I am open to releasing it.”</li>
  <li>“Even though I’ve been carrying this heaviness, I allow myself to let it go.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Beautiful. Now, let’s move to the space just above your eyebrows. Gently tap here, breathing deeply in and out through your nose. As you tap, bring awareness to the fear, the anxiety, or the tension you may be carrying. There’s no need to fix it right now—just let it be. You are simply allowing yourself to witness whatever arises.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I release this fear from my heart.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now move your fingers to the sides of your eyes. Keep tapping gently. Remind yourself: you are safe here, in this moment.</p>

<p>The act of tapping sends a calming signal to your brain’s stress center—the amygdala—which begins to soothe and calm your whole system. Allow yourself to feel that reassurance. You are safe. You are supported. You are here, and nothing is required of you except to be present.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am safe. I am allowed to feel whatever I feel.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now tap just under your eyes. This is the place where so much emotion can hold, especially those tender thoughts and worries that keep us up at night. Hold space for whatever is keeping you awake, stressed, or anxious. Let the thoughts rise, but don’t try to control them. Simply acknowledge them with tenderness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I release the weight of these worries.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now bring your fingers to the space between your nose and upper lip. Gently ask yourself:</p>

<p>“Why is it so hard to let go of this fear?”</p>

<p>Allow whatever thoughts come up, without judgment. Perhaps fear has kept you safe in certain ways. Perhaps it’s tied to past experiences. Whatever it is, allow it to come up, but do not hold it tightly. You are simply observing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I release the need to hold on to what no longer serves me.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, move your fingers just below your bottom lip, above the chin. Keep tapping gently, holding the intention of release, of opening. You’re acknowledging the space of fear and giving yourself permission to let go of it, gently.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It’s safe to let go of this fear now.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, bring your hands to your collarbone and tap gently with all of your fingers here. Imagine the emotion softening. See it loosening its grip, beginning to shift and dissolve. Whisper to yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“It’s safe to let go.”</li>
  <li>“I am supported.”</li>
  <li>“I am not alone in this.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, move to under your arm—about a hand-width below the armpit. Keep breathing deeply, letting the tapping send soothing waves through your nervous system. Imagine that with each tap, you are gently releasing the fear that has built up over time, allowing your body to relax, to open, to release.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am ready to release what no longer serves me.”</li>
  <li>“I am choosing peace now.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, bring your fingers to the top of your head, gently tapping at your crown. Let this be a reminder of your inner strength:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am ready to step into clarity.”</li>
  <li>“I am free from the weight of fear.”</li>
  <li>“I am home in myself.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s now go around again, starting at the space above your eyebrows. This time, let it be a round of release and renewal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I release this burden from my heart.”</li>
  <li>“I release this stress from my body.”</li>
  <li>“I now choose peace.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Tap the sides of your eyes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am no longer willing to carry what is not mine.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Under your eyes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I give myself permission to feel safe now.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Above your lip:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am open to the possibility of ease.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Below your lip:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am enough, just as I am.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Collarbone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I’m choosing calm. I’m choosing love.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the arm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I welcome healing into my nervous system.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Top of the head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I am free. I am safe. I am home in myself.”</li>
</ul>
