            <h2>Lesson 2: EFT for Money Blocks</h2>

<p>With love from a holistic space of healing and truth</p>

<p>Welcome, dear one. I’m so grateful you’re here. This is a sacred space—a gentle moment carved out just for you—to tend to the emotional weight you may be carrying around money.</p>

<p>Today, we’re not here to hustle or to force change. We’re here to soften, to listen inward, and to begin releasing the old patterns and beliefs that may have kept you feeling stuck, small, or unworthy when it comes to financial flow.</p>

<p>This is Emotional Freedom Technique, or EFT. It's a beautiful, body-based practice that helps release emotional energy stored in our nervous systems. As we tap, breathe, and speak truth to what’s real for us, we create space—space for compassion, space for clarity, and space for abundance to gently return home to us.</p>

<h2>Grounding Into the Present Moment</h2>

<p>Let’s begin by grounding into the present moment. If it feels safe, place one hand on your heart and the other on your belly. Allow your eyes to gently close.</p>

<p>Now breathe with me:</p>
<p>Inhale deeply… letting love in. Hold for three, two, one… Exhale slowly… letting tension melt away.</p>
<p>Again, inhale peace… Hold for one, two, three… Exhale and soften even more.</p>
<p>One last time, breathe in spaciousness… Hold… and release, fully and gently.</p>

<p>Beautiful. You are already doing so well.</p>

<h2>Tuning Into Your Body</h2>

<p>Now, take a moment to tune into your body. Bring to mind your current experience with money—whether it’s stress, fear, frustration, or uncertainty. Just notice what arises. No need to fix or analyze. Simply feel.</p>

<p>Scan your body… Where does this energy sit? What emotion is present? On a scale of 1 to 10, where does the intensity land for you right now? There is no right or wrong—only awareness.</p>

<h2>Beginning the EFT Tapping</h2>

<p>When you’re ready, begin tapping on the karate chop point (the outer edge of your hand) and repeat after me, gently:</p>

<p>Even though I feel overwhelmed by money right now, I honor where I am, and I deeply love and accept myself.</p>
<p>Even though I feel like I’m not where I “should” be financially, I choose to be kind and patient with myself.</p>
<p>Even though money has felt heavy, scarce, or like a constant struggle, I am open to healing this part of my story.</p>

<h2>Tapping Through the Points</h2>

<p><strong>Eyebrow:</strong> This tension I feel around money...</p>
<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> The fear of not having enough…</p>
<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> The weight of trying to always stay ahead…</p>
<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> The shame I sometimes carry about what I have—or don’t have…</p>
<p><strong>Chin:</strong> The pressure to always do more, earn more, prove more…</p>
<p><strong>Collarbone:</strong> This tightness in my chest when I think about finances…</p>
<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> This survival energy I’ve been living in…</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I honor these feelings, and I offer myself compassion.</p>

<p>Take a breath here… and gently exhale.</p>

<h2>Inviting in a New Story</h2>

<p><strong>Eyebrow:</strong> What if I could trust that money can come to me in ways that feel aligned and supportive?</p>
<p><strong>Side of the Eye:</strong> What if I don’t have to struggle to be worthy of receiving?</p>
<p><strong>Under the Eye:</strong> Maybe it’s safe to let go of the old patterns…</p>
<p><strong>Under the Nose:</strong> Maybe abundance doesn’t have to feel hard.</p>
<p><strong>Chin:</strong> I am open to receiving—not just money, but support, peace, and possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Collarbone:</strong> I am learning to believe that I am enough, just as I am.</p>
<p><strong>Under the Arm:</strong> I am becoming a safe and loving container for abundance.</p>
<p><strong>Top of the Head:</strong> I am rewriting my relationship with money—one breath, one belief, one tap at a time.</p>

<p>Take another full, loving breath in… And slowly release.</p>

<h2>Integrating the Practice</h2>

<p>Now tune in again. Has the energy shifted, even slightly? What do you notice in your body? Has the number on your scale changed? Be gentle with whatever is present.</p>

<p>Money wounds run deep, love. They’re often woven into early experiences, family patterns, societal messaging, and generational imprints. And still—there is hope. Because healing is always possible. Safety is something you can cultivate. And abundance… it begins within.</p>

<p>So today, perhaps take one gentle action. Speak kindly to yourself about money. Let yourself receive help. Create something. Open to being seen. Say yes to what wants to support you.</p>

<p>This practice is here for you anytime. You are not broken. You are becoming. And you are so deeply worthy of ease, of freedom, of financial flow that aligns with your soul.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing this sacred space with me. Be gentle. You are doing beautifully. I’ll see you in the next session.</p>
