              <p>
    Sometimes, it whispers in the form of self-doubt. It looks like questioning your memories,
    apologizing for things you didn’t do, or shrinking to make someone else comfortable.
    It can show up as feeling like you're walking on eggshells, like your worth is always up for negotiation.
    Often, it’s a slow erosion of your sense of self until you no longer recognize who you were before the relationship.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Tactics Used in Narcissistic Abuse</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Gaslighting:</strong> A psychological tactic designed to distort your reality. 
      <p>
        It begins subtly—a comment here, a denial there—but over time, it becomes the foundation of confusion.
        You might be told, “You’re overreacting,” or “That never happened.” I vividly remember a time I brought up
        something hurtful that was said, and the response I got was, “You always twist things.” 
        I started second-guessing everything, from my emotional responses to my very sanity.
        I eventually started documenting conversations, not for proof to them—but to remind myself that my reality was real.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Love-Bombing & Idealization:</strong> The beginning often feels like a whirlwind fairy tale.
      <p>
        Constant praise, deep emotional intimacy, intense declarations of love. You feel seen in a way you never have before.
        But what’s happening is often a carefully crafted mirror. They reflect back your dreams, values, and wounds to form a bond of dependency.
        I once believed I had found someone who understood me on a soul level, only to later realize they were studying me
        to use those very vulnerabilities as tools of control.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Devaluation, Discard & Hoovering:</strong> Once you’re emotionally invested, the mask begins to slip.
      <p>
        Criticism replaces compliments. Affection is withdrawn. You’re left wondering what you did wrong. 
        Then comes the discard—sudden emotional or physical abandonment. Just when you begin to piece yourself together, 
        they reappear, flooding your phone with sweet messages, apologies, or feigned concern. 
        This cycle reinforces the trauma bond—a biochemical addiction to the push-pull dynamic. 
        I remember thinking, “Maybe this time, they’ve really changed.” But each return only deepened the wound.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Projection & Triangulation:</strong> Narcissists are notorious for blaming others for what they themselves are doing.
      <p>
        If they are lying, they’ll accuse you of dishonesty. If they are cheating, they’ll paint you as unfaithful. 
        Triangulation involves introducing third parties—real or imagined—to stir jealousy or competition. 
        You might be told how much more understanding their ex was, or that someone else thinks you’re overreacting. 
        It’s a method to keep you destabilized, always vying for approval. 
        I began to see a pattern—every time I regained some footing, a third party would be mentioned to throw me off balance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Silent Treatment:</strong> One of the most excruciating forms of psychological control.
      <p>
        You’re shut out, ignored, made to feel invisible. This isn’t a healthy pause; it’s a punishment. 
        It’s designed to trigger panic and self-blame. I once went days without a single word in response after a minor disagreement,
        spiraling into anxiety, begging for resolution. That silence wasn’t peace—it was emotional cruelty.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reclaiming Your Clarity</h3>
  <p>
    Understanding these tactics is the first <strong>sacred step</strong> in waking up from the fog. 
    You begin to recognize patterns not as reflections of your flaws, but as strategies of manipulation. 
    You realize: <strong>This wasn’t my fault.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    And even more importantly—you begin to reclaim your clarity. Your intuition. Your truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Give yourself permission to feel the anger, the sadness, the betrayal. 
    These are not signs of weakness, but evidence of your return to self. 
    Awareness is not just knowledge—it is <strong>liberation</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t need anyone else to validate your experience. <strong>Your pain is valid.</strong> 
    <strong>Your healing is sacred.</strong> And <strong>you are worthy of a love that does not ask you to lose yourself to keep it.</strong>
