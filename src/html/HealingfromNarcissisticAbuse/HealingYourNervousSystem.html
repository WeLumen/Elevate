            <h2 class="section-title">Lesson 3: Healing Your Nervous System</h2>
            <p>
    Trauma does not resolve through words alone. You cannot think your way out of a dysregulated nervous system,
    nor can you reason yourself into calm. <strong>Healing, especially from trauma, begins not in the mind but in the body.</strong>
    Your body is the first to know danger, and it must be the first to know safety.
    <strong>This is the foundation:</strong> until the body feels safe, the mind cannot fully relax.
  </p>
  <p>
    We often try to “figure it out,” to analyze our way into healing—but trauma doesn’t live in the logical part of the brain.
    It lives in the body, in the breath, in the heartbeat, in the muscles that remain clenched long after the threat has passed.
    Healing the nervous system means tending to the body’s language, its cues, its signals.
    It means creating a new relationship with safety—not as an idea, but as a felt experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Breathwork: Reconnecting with the Body’s Rhythm</h3>
  <p>
    Start each morning by reconnecting to your breath. This is the most accessible tool you have—always with you, always waiting.
    Try box breathing, a simple and effective way to bring your nervous system out of a stress response and into regulation.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inhale gently through your nose for a count of 4.</li>
    <li>Hold the breath for 4.</li>
    <li>Exhale slowly through your mouth for 4.</li>
    <li>Hold again for 4.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Repeat this cycle for two minutes or more, ideally each morning, before you check your phone or talk to anyone else.
    This is your moment to come back home to yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you breathe, bring your awareness to your physical body. Notice your feet pressing into the ground beneath you.
    Feel the steadiness of the floor. Notice how your belly rises with each inhale and gently falls with each exhale.
    These are not just breaths; they are cues of safety, rhythm, and return.
    <strong>Every breath is a whisper to your nervous system: “You are safe now.”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, with consistency, this breath ritual becomes a bridge back to your body—
    a reliable, calming rhythm that softens tension and invites presence.
  </p>

  <h3>Grounding Practices: Anchoring Yourself in the Now</h3>
  <p>
    When we’ve experienced trauma—whether big or small, sudden or subtle—our awareness is often hijacked.
    We may find ourselves stuck in the past, re-living moments that hurt.
    Or we leap forward into the future, anticipating danger that hasn’t yet arrived.
    In both cases, the present moment is lost.
    <strong>Grounding practices are invitations to return to now</strong>—to this moment, this breath, this body, this place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Begin with the earth itself. Take your shoes off and go outside.
    Let your bare feet touch the grass, the soil, the pavement. It doesn’t matter where—what matters is the direct contact.
    Feel the texture beneath your feet. Let the ground support you. Let it remind you that you belong here.
    You are not floating away—you are rooted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try holding a warm mug of tea or water with both hands. Wrap your fingers around the cup.
    Feel the temperature. Notice the weight. This simple act pulls your awareness back into your hands,
    into sensation, into the present.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also use a <strong>5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique</strong> to reorient yourself gently to the here and now:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5 things you can see</strong> — Look around. Let your eyes land on shapes, colors, light.</li>
    <li><strong>4 things you can feel</strong> — The fabric of your clothes, the air on your skin, the chair beneath you.</li>
    <li><strong>3 things you can hear</strong> — Listen beyond the obvious. A clock ticking, distant traffic, a bird.</li>
    <li><strong>2 things you can smell</strong> — Take a deep breath. Can you catch a scent in the room or outside?</li>
    <li><strong>1 thing you can taste</strong> — Even the taste in your mouth right now counts.</li>
  </ul>
