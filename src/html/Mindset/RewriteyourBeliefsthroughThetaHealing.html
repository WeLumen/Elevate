            <h2>Lesson 4: Rewrite your Beliefs through Theta Healing </h2>

            <p><strong>Welcome to a Sacred Space for Change</strong></p>
            <p>
              This immersive mini course invites you into a sacred, nurturing space to begin one of the most powerful journeys you'll ever take—the journey within. 
              Through the profound practice of Theta Healing, you'll be gently guided to explore and release limiting beliefs that may have shaped your self-worth, 
              your relationships, and the way you move through the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              These beliefs, often formed in childhood or passed down through generations, can live quietly in the subconscious mind—yet they influence everything 
              from the choices we make to the emotions we feel. With Theta Healing, we don't just analyze these patterns—we shift them, energetically and spiritually, at their root.
            </p>
          
            <h3>What Is Theta Healing?</h3>
            <p>
              Theta Healing is both a meditative technique and a spiritual healing modality. It taps into the theta brainwave state, a deeply relaxed frequency where our subconscious beliefs are accessible and malleable. From this space, we can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify hidden programs that hold us back</li>
              <li>Release emotional trauma stored in the energy field</li>
              <li>Create space for new beliefs that reflect our true essence</li>
              <li>Reconnect with our own innate wisdom and divine source</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Theta Healing is rooted in the understanding that beliefs are powerful architects of reality, and by changing them, we transform how we experience ourselves, others, and the world.
            </p>
          
            <h3>What You’ll Receive in This Course</h3>
            <p>
              This course has been designed as a gentle yet powerful initiation into the belief work at the heart of Theta Healing. Whether you are new to energy healing or familiar with spiritual practices, this course offers deep value and lasting insight.
            </p>
          
            <h4>Heart-Centered Breathing & Radiating Love</h4>
            <p>
              You’ll begin with a grounding, heart-opening breath practice that brings your awareness into the present moment. This practice centers your energy and raises your vibration, creating a safe and sacred space for transformation. You’ll be guided to radiate love—from the inside out—cultivating a felt experience of compassion and connection.
            </p>
            <p><em>You are reminded: healing doesn’t begin with fixing—it begins with loving.</em></p>
          
            <h4>The Power of Belief Change</h4>
            <p>
              In this teaching session, you’ll explore the layers of conscious and unconscious beliefs and how they shape every area of life—from relationships to abundance, from self-worth to health. 
              You’ll be shown how to gently identify beliefs that no longer serve you, and how to energetically release and replace them through visualization, feeling work, and intentional spiritual connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learn how to move beyond inherited stories and limiting self-concepts, and step into a life aligned with your soul’s truth.
            </p>
          
            <h3>Deeper Benefits of Theta Healing</h3>
            <p>This course is not just informational—it is experiential. You will be gently guided into your inner landscape to experience the following shifts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Release of Emotional Baggage:</strong> Old emotions tied to limiting beliefs can be gently released, creating emotional spaciousness and calm.</li>

              <li><strong>Spiritual Alignment:</strong> This work brings you back into harmony with your higher self, your divine source, and your soul’s true desires.</li>
              <li><strong>Holistic Wellness:</strong> Energetic healing often brings renewed energy, better sleep, and a deep sense of emotional balance.</li>
              <li><strong>Empowerment & Clarity:</strong> When old beliefs are released, life feels lighter. You make choices from love, not fear.</li>
            </ul>
