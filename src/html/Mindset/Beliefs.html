            <h2>Lesson 2: Beliefs </h2>

                
              
                <p>In this healing workshop, we will lovingly explore where many of our core beliefs come from — and how these beliefs, often formed in childhood, can unconsciously keep us caught in painful patterns, including relationships with narcissists.</p>
              
                <p>Every one of us carries a unique set of inner stories, shaped by our early experiences, by the families we grew up in, and by the messages we received from the world around us.
                When we find ourselves repeatedly drawn into toxic relationships, it's rarely because there’s something “wrong” with us — but rather because, deep inside, certain old wounds are still calling out for healing.</p>
              
                <p>And this is not about blame — especially not self-blame.
                It’s about compassionately understanding ourselves so that we can lovingly break these old cycles and step forward into a life of greater wholeness, joy, and self-honoring.</p>
              
                <p>I, too, have walked this path.
                For many years, I found myself entangled in relationships that drained my spirit, including with narcissistic partners. It wasn’t until I made a courageous decision to truly look within — to gently explore my own patterns with love and curiosity — that I began to experience true, lasting change.
                Healing began when I turned toward myself with compassion, not judgment.</p>
              
                <p>One turning point for me was reading <em>Women Who Love Too Much</em> by Robin Norwood. After finally leaving a deeply painful relationship in 2011, I felt overwhelmed, lost, and desperate for understanding. I hadn’t even heard of narcissistic personality disorder at the time — I just knew that the emotional and psychological abuse, the gaslighting, the endless games, the love-bombing followed by cruel discard, were tearing me apart.
                Every time I tried to leave, promises of change — or clever manipulations — would pull me back in.</p>
              
                <p>Finally, after walking away for good, a dear friend recommended <em>Women Who Love Too Much</em>. I remember feeling shy as I wandered through the self-help section of the bookstore... but my heart knew I needed something.
                Before I even finished the first chapter, tears were streaming down my face.
                It was a moment of profound awakening:
                I realized that my repeated painful relationships were not random.
                They were connected to the wounds I carried from childhood — wounds I hadn't yet been given the tools or the support to heal.</p>
              
                <p>The narcissists were not the cause of my wounds; they were a symptom — a mirror reflecting beliefs about myself that had quietly taken root when I was very young.</p>
              
                <p>You see, the beliefs we hold — about ourselves, about love, about what we deserve — become the lenses through which we see the world.
                They shape how we interpret every interaction, every relationship, every moment.</p>
              
                <h2>Let’s explore a simple example:</h2>
              
                <p>Imagine you walk into a bar to meet friends.
                As you approach the table, you notice your friends chatting and laughing, and then one of them spots you and quickly whispers, "Shhh, she's coming!"</p>
              
                <p>If you hold a deep belief that you are lovable, cherished, and valued, you might smile and think, "How sweet! Maybe they’re planning a surprise for me!" You would feel loved, and the evening would unfold with warmth and joy.</p>
              
                <p>But if, deep down, old wounds have led you to believe you are not enough, not truly loved, you might instead feel hurt. You might interpret the same scene as rejection — imagining they were speaking unkindly about you — and the evening might spiral into sadness or defensiveness, confirming the painful story you already carry inside.</p>
              
                <p><strong>Same moment.<br>Two different inner worlds.<br>Two different realities.</strong></p>
              
                <p>This is the power of our beliefs.
                They quietly, profoundly create the way we experience life.</p>
              
                <h2>Now, let’s gently bring this understanding into our relationships with narcissists.</h2>
              
                <p>When a narcissist begins to devalue us — when the cruelty, the blame, the emotional manipulation begins — our reaction is not just based on what they are doing, but also on what we already believe about ourselves.</p>
              
                <p>For example, the first time my ex raised his voice and blamed me, only a month into the relationship, I argued back. I thought I was standing up for myself. But somewhere deep within, because of the way I was conditioned as a child — made to feel responsible for things that were never mine to carry — a part of me unconsciously accepted the blame.</p>
              
                <p>Children who grow up feeling responsible for others' feelings or carrying unwarranted guilt can later become adults who tolerate unfair treatment — simply because it feels familiar.
                Because, on some level, it fits the old blueprint they were handed.</p>
              
                <p>Someone without these inner wounds might have walked away at the first sign of disrespect, knowing deeply: "I am worthy of love that feels safe and kind."
                But for those of us with tender, unhealed places, the narcissist’s manipulation taps directly into our insecurities and fears, reinforcing the painful cycles.</p>
              
                <p>And again — <strong>this is not your fault.</strong>
                This is about awareness and healing, not shame.</p>
              
                <p>When we deeply understand how our early experiences shaped our beliefs, we can begin to reclaim our power.
                We can stop accepting mistreatment as normal.
                We can stop making others' cruelty mean something about our own worth.
                We can begin to love ourselves fiercely, tenderly, and truly.</p>
              
                <p><strong>Breaking free is not just about leaving the narcissist.
                It’s about healing the parts within us that made their behavior tolerable in the first place.</strong></p>
              
                <h2>One important thing I often share in my groups is this:</h2>
              
                <p>Notice the lies the narcissist tells you that you don’t believe.
                For example, if a narcissist accuses you of being a terrible mother or selfish — and deep inside you know that’s not true — it’s because your soul has not accepted that false story.
                Your truth is stronger.</p>
              
                <p>But when a narcissist says something that hurts, something that hooks you — it’s often because a tiny wounded part of you believes it, even if you don’t want to.
                And that is where the healing wants to happen.</p>
              
                <p>If someone told you that you are "too difficult to love," and you believe them, it's because an old, buried wound has made space for that lie to land.
                But if you heal that wound, their words lose all their power over you.</p>
              
                <p><strong>Beloved soul, you are not broken.
                You are remembering your wholeness.
                And every small step you take to reclaim your truth brings you closer to the love and joy you truly deserve.</strong></p>
              
                <p>Let’s walk this healing journey together — gently, patiently, and with immense compassion for ourselves.
                You are worthy of a life filled with kindness, safety, and deep, abiding love.</p>
