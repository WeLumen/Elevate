  <p class="intro">
    To gain a better understanding of what digital transformation is, it is useful to look at how technology creation and adoption has impacted our everyday life.
  </p>
  <div class="content-section">
    <div class="text-block">
      <p>
        Let's consider the example of the telephone. Since its introduction, the telephone has followed an adoption curve that has gradually evolved over time. This progression indicates a notable improvement in its capabilities. The journey of telephones began with traditional landline models plugged into walls, and has now advanced to the smartphone, which was introduced more than a decade ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today the smartphone, which essentially functions as a computer, has more adoption in a shorter amount of time than the landline telephone did. The smartphone contains the same capabilities as a computer when it comes to computing, storage, and connectivity.

    Like the telephone, technology is being adopted faster than ever today. Technology that used to take years to create and adopt is now being adopted at faster speeds and efficiency. The example of the telephone shows how digital transformation has reached all areas of society on a global scale.

    The agricultural industry is not the only industry experiencing rapid growth due to the implementation of digital transformation. In fact, various sectors, such as manufacturing, health care, finance, and retail, are also witnessing significant advancements and improvements through this transformative process. Let’s take a closer look at digital transformation in the sports, education, and health care industries.</p>

  <div class="tab-content active" id="sports">
    <p>
    The sports industry embraces digital transformation for growth opportunities. They are pursuing this strategy for several reasons, including expanding their content reach, driving the fan experience, generating revenue, and improving player and team performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American National Football League (NFL) is an example of a digital transformation in process. Players’ equipment, such as shoulder pads, comes equipped with an RFID chip to collect data from players’ movements on the field. The data is then used to improve individual and team performance. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-content" id="education">
    <p>
      The education sector is undergoing a shift with digital transformation, adapting traditional teaching methods to accommodate digitized technology and cater to diverse learner needs. While traditional forms of education almost completely evolved around in-person classroom learning, today there are other methods of instruction and learning such as remote and hybrid learning formats. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The digitization of education expands offerings and opportunities, including certificate programs and professional development outside traditional university degree programs. Additionally, online learning has allowed people from all over the world to take classes outside of limited geographical areas.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="tab-content" id="health">
    <p>
      The health care industry increasingly relies on digital technology to enhance health care delivery and address medical issues. An example of this is the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs replace traditional paper-based patient records with electronic systems. With EHRs, health care providers can access a patient’s medical history, lab results, prescriptions, and other relevant information quickly and securely. EHRs also facilitate data collection on a large scale, which can be anonymized and used for research, health management, and identifying trends or patterns in diseases and treatments.
