            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to your course  Relationships & Communication. This course is divided into 8 modules.</p>
                    <h2>Module 1: Healing Your Nervous System</h2>
                    <p>This first module invites you into a sacred space of restoration and reconnection. Here, we begin the gentle journey of healing your nervous system, the core of your emotional and physical well-being. Through somatic awareness and breathwork, you’ll learn how to calm the inner storm, release stored tension, and return to a state of balance. These practices are an invitation to come home to your body with compassion and presence, awakening your innate capacity to self-regulate and heal.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 2: Introduction to Somatics</h2>
                    <p>This module is a soft and grounded introduction to the world of somatics — the art of listening deeply to your body’s wisdom. Across these four parts, you'll learn how to cultivate embodied awareness, move through emotional blocks, and align with your heart’s desires. Through gentle exercises and intentional practices, you’ll reconnect with your body as a sacred guide. By the end of this module, you’ll feel more attuned to your truth and more empowered to create from a place of embodiment.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 3: Somatics Dance Healing Workshop</h2>
                    <p>Movement becomes medicine in this transformative module. Dance is one of the most ancient ways to release, reclaim, and express. Here, somatic dance becomes a powerful tool for emotional release, nervous system regulation, and feminine embodiment. Each class in this workshop is an invitation to move beyond the mind and into your body’s rhythms — awakening your divine feminine energy, honoring your emotions, and healing through sacred movement and stillness.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 4: From Emotional Mess to Mastery</h2>
                    <p>In this module, we step into the emotional alchemy of turning pain into power. With tenderness and honesty, we explore the emotional layers that often feel overwhelming — and begin the process of mastery through awareness, compassion, and skillful self-regulation. This is not about bypassing your emotions, but about learning how to hold them with grace, transform them with presence, and free yourself from the patterns that keep you stuck in fear and pain.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 5: Transformative Eating Habits</h2>
                    <p>Eating is an emotional experience — and in this module, we embrace it as a path of deep healing. Together, we explore the inner landscape of your relationship with food and body. Through meditations, affirmations, and somatic awareness, you'll gently shift the narrative from shame and control to love and nourishment. Each lesson is a loving step toward reclaiming your body, trusting your inner wisdom, and healing your relationship with eating in a way that feels sustainable, soulful, and kind.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 6: Nourish Not Punish — Blueprint to Defeat Emotional Eating</h2>
                    <p>This module is a powerful reset. It offers you a compassionate roadmap to move beyond emotional eating patterns by understanding their root causes and offering yourself what you truly need: care, safety, connection. Instead of punishing your body, you will learn how to nourish it — physically, emotionally, and spiritually. These teachings will help you rebuild a loving connection with yourself, rooted in presence, compassion, and embodied self-respect.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 7: The 6-Day Blueprint from Survival to Absolute</h2>
                    <p>In this immersive 6-day journey, you’ll be guided step-by-step from a state of survival — where fear and overwhelm may run the show — to a space of clarity, confidence, and inner alignment. Each day is crafted with care to help you regulate your emotions, connect with your body, and activate the part of you that knows how to rise. This is a deep initiation into resilience, wholeness, and self-leadership. The transformation is not rushed — it is nurtured, one conscious breath and one intentional step at a time.</p>
                
                    <h2>Module 8: Becoming More Resilient</h2>
                    <p>Resilience is not about being unaffected by life — it’s about learning how to return to yourself, again and again, no matter what arises. In this final module, we anchor everything you’ve learned into a deeper sense of inner strength. Through embodiment, emotional presence, and gentle practices, you’ll build the nervous system capacity to hold more of life with grace. This is your invitation to walk forward with trust in your body, your path, and your power to create lasting transformation from within.</p>
