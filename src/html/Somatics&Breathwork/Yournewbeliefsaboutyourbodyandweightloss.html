            <h2>Lesson 3: Your new beliefs about your body and weight loss</h2>

            <p>I open myself to fully accept who I am, just as I am.</p>
            <p>I recognize that my weight is simply a number, a passing reflection, and it does not define me or my worth. The people who truly matter see my efforts to care for myself, and they support me in my journey. Others' opinions are theirs to hold, but they do not affect me. Their judgments are simply projections of their own insecurities.</p>
    
            <p>I choose to see my past challenges as valuable lessons, not failures. I now understand that those moments were opportunities to learn, grow, and gain wisdom. I have all the time I need to release excess weight, and I can embrace the process with grace, joy, and ease. I don’t need to wait for a specific number on the scale to feel happy or confident. True confidence comes from within and radiates outward.</p>
    
            <p>I honor that not everyone faces the same challenges with weight, but I know that happiness and confidence are not defined by body size. I create my own happiness with my thoughts, my actions, and my loving attention to myself.</p>
    
            <p>I build my confidence by gently stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing the discomfort of growth. I am capable of doing hard things, no matter where I am in my journey. My body is not something to hide or criticize—it is a beautiful vessel that carries me through this life, supporting me in incredible ways.</p>
    
            <p>I release the unkind words I may have used about myself, like calling myself “fat.” Those words no longer serve me, and they do not reflect the truth of who I am. I appreciate my body for all it does for me, and I am deeply grateful for its health, strength, and wisdom. It knows the way to my ideal size and shape, and all I need to do is listen with compassion.</p>
    
            <p>I gently remind myself that my weight does not define me. I am not my weight; I am not my body. I simply have a body, and it is a beautiful, sacred part of me. The fat on my body is just that—fat. It can change, shift, and be released when the time is right. It’s not something to fear or hold tightly to.</p>
    
            <p>When I focus on feeling heavy or “fat,” I remain stuck in that perception. But when I choose to focus on how light, radiant, and free I can feel, that’s when my reality begins to shift. I know that someone who has just lost 20 pounds still carries the same body but may feel lighter because of their perception. Feeling “slim” or “fat” is just that—a perception.</p>
    
            <p>I practice shifting my perception to one of lightness and ease, and as I do, I naturally attract that into my reality. Over time, this will become more effortless, because my mind will begin to filter out evidence of old beliefs and focus on the new.</p>
    
            <p>I trust that the weight will release, but I’m not in a rush. I don’t desire a quick fix, because I know that lasting change comes from loving patience and consistent, compassionate action. I am here for the long term, creating permanent, sustainable changes with a belief that is unwavering.</p>
    
            <p>I choose not to weigh myself frequently, as I know that natural fluctuations in my body can lead to unnecessary stress or emotional responses. Weight loss is not linear, and the journey is filled with ups and downs. I trust that each step, each experience, is part of my body’s natural rhythm.</p>
    
            <p>Desperation never leads to lasting change. When I surrender and allow the process to unfold with ease, I am letting go of resistance. I trust that I will reach my healthiest weight when I act from a place of relaxation and joy, not effort and strain.</p>
    
            <p>I nourish my body with simple, loving actions—eating when I’m hungry, stopping when I’m satisfied, moving my body regularly, and giving myself rest. I move forward with love, focusing on living a full and joyful life, not obsessing over the scale.</p>
    
            <p>I am learning to embody the mindset and energy of someone who is free from weight struggles.</p>
    
            <p>When I don’t see immediate progress, I don’t panic. Becoming upset or anxious about my body only leads to stress and frustration, and I know that this will only push me toward emotional eating to soothe myself. I gently release the urge to control and instead trust that my body is on its own beautiful journey.</p>
    
            <p>I embody the characteristics, thoughts, and feelings of someone who is at peace with themselves—someone who no longer feels trapped by their weight or body image. I know that it is perfectly safe to feel my feelings, and I honor them. The answers I seek are not in food, but in the emotions I choose to feel and embrace.</p>
    
            <p>My personality, my actions, and my energy are what define who I am. People love and appreciate me for my heart, my humor, and my essence—not for the number on the scale. Those who truly love me want nothing more than to see me happy, confident, and at peace in my own skin.</p>
    
            <p>I choose not to be my own harshest critic. I recognize that my body is simply a vessel for my soul. I have thoughts, but those thoughts are not who I am. Sometimes, I may have negative thoughts, and that’s okay. I won’t judge myself for them. Instead, I choose to gently replace unhelpful thoughts with those that empower me and help me feel good.</p>
    
            <p>I respect myself by taking breaks when I need them. I schedule moments of rest and self-care throughout my day, honoring my need to recharge and restore my energy.</p>
    
            <p>Carbohydrates are just a form of nourishment, providing the energy my body needs to function. My body sometimes needs more energy, sometimes less, and I trust its wisdom. Complex carbohydrates help me feel more satisfied, and by including them in my meals, I am able to maintain a balanced, healthy relationship with food.</p>
    
            <p>My family and I nourish ourselves with healthy, wholesome foods, knowing that food is abundant, and we are not deprived. There will always be more food. I don’t need to eat everything today, and I allow myself to enjoy the experience of eating in a balanced, mindful way.</p>
    
            <p>There is no need to restrict or deprive myself. I can have small portions of foods I enjoy without guilt, and I trust my ability to make mindful choices that honor my body and my health.</p>
    
            <p>I trust my metabolism and my body’s natural needs. I listen to the cues my body gives me, respecting its needs and honoring its wisdom.</p>
