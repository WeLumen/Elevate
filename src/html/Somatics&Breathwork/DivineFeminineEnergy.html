            <h2>Lesson 2: Divine Feminine Energy Embodiment Somatic Dance Healing Class</h2>

                <p>Now that we’ve laid the foundation of what somatics truly means—coming home to the body and listening to its language—let’s gently begin exploring some simple, powerful practices you can integrate into your daily life.</p>
                <p>These exercises are here to support you in reconnecting with your physical self—to feel how your body moves, how it communicates, and how it stores wisdom, emotion, and sensation. You don't need to "get it right" or perform these perfectly. Let that idea go. There is no right or wrong way here. This is about presence, not performance.</p>
                <p>So often, we’ve been taught to “do” instead of feel, to “fix” rather than listen. But true healing happens when we meet ourselves …</p>
              
                <h2>Somatic Healing Movement Class – Guided Session Script</h2>
                <p>Welcome. Thank you for being here. This session is designed to support your healing, presence, and embodiment. Together, we’ll explore somatic practices that help reconnect you to your body’s wisdom and the powerful energy that resides within.</p>
              
                <h3>Introduction to Somatic Healing</h3>
                <p>Somatic healing is the practice of tuning in to the body—our soma—to connect with the subconscious mind. Rather than engaging with the stories or thoughts from the mind, we’ll focus on physical sensations and emotional energy. Emotions are meant to move through us, but sometimes they get stuck or suppressed, especially when they haven't been processed fully. This session offers space for safe expression, gentle release, and deep restoration.</p>
                <p>Through a blend of breathwork, meditation, affirmations, and intuitive movement, the intention is to quiet the mind and let the body lead. There is no right or wrong way to move—only what feels true for you. Allow yourself the freedom to explore, express, and flow.</p>
              
                <h3>Grounding Practice: Two Bells Breath</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Inhale through your nose, imagining a high, clear bell tone.</li>
                  <li>Exhale through your nose as you visualize a deeper, resonant bell.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Let the breath expand your belly and flow through your body. With each inhale, draw in oxygen and energy. With each exhale, release tension and allow calm to settle in. Take two more deep breaths with this rhythm, grounding yourself fully in the present moment.</p>
              
                <h3>Body Awareness: Body Scan</h3>
                <p>Find a comfortable position—sitting, standing, or lying down. Allow your spine to lengthen, your chest to open, and your hands to rest in a receptive position.</p>
                <p>Gently tune in to your current state. Without judgment, notice how you’re feeling on a scale from one to ten. Simply acknowledge what’s here.</p>
                <p>Set a gentle intention for your practice. Today’s focus is on honoring your inherent value and reconnecting to your inner light.</p>
                <p>Starting at the crown of the head, guide your awareness slowly down through your body. Notice any sensations—tingling, warmth, pressure, or stillness. Wherever you find tightness or heaviness, send breath and compassion to that space.</p>
                <p>Continue this gentle scan through your face, neck, shoulders, arms, heart, belly, hips, legs, and feet—softening, opening, and grounding.</p>
                <p>Then reverse the flow: visualize a gentle current of energy rising from the earth through your feet, legs, spine, and all the way to the crown of your head. Receive the light that flows through you and surrounds you.</p>
              
                <h3>Movement Exploration</h3>
                <p>Begin to move slowly and intuitively. Roll your neck, stretch gently, and follow any impulses that arise. If a particular area calls for your attention, breathe into it. Let your body guide the pace and form.</p>
                <p>Circle your hips, allowing softness and flow. Breathe into the heart space, letting go of emotional tension. As you move, know that release is a part of healing—allow space for it without resistance.</p>
                <p>Twist the spine gently to activate and energize. Take cleansing breaths with each motion, encouraging vitality to flow freely.</p>
              
                <h3>Shake + Dance to Release</h3>
                <p>Now it’s time to shake. Let your body move freely. Shake out the tension, stress, and stuck emotions. There’s no structure—just allow movement to emerge.</p>
                <p>Dance, laugh, sway, stretch—whatever your body wants. This is a sacred moment to embody freedom and joy.</p>
                <p>Pause when you feel ready. Sip water if needed. Reconnect with your breath, your presence, and your intention.</p>
              
                <h3>Movement Meditation</h3>
                <p>Place your hands gently over your heart. Feel your warmth, your pulse, your presence.</p>
                <p>Begin to slide your hands down your body with intention. As you move, imagine each part of you lighting up—turning to gold, shimmering with vitality and worth. With every breath, soften even more.</p>
                <p><strong>Affirm gently:</strong><br>I am valuable. I am loved. I am abundant.</p>
                <p>Feel these words resonate in every cell.</p>
                <p>Bring your awareness to the present moment. Close your eyes, and be with your breath. Let yourself soak in the stillness, the grace, and the healing power of presence.</p>
              
                <h3>Final Meditation: Energy Integration</h3>
                <p>Find a relaxed position—seated or lying down. Palms can face upward or rest on your heart.</p>
                <p>Breathe deeply. With each inhale, connect with your heart’s rhythm and your intention for healing. What are you calling in? Release? Renewal? A deeper recognition of your worth?</p>
                <p><strong>Repeat inwardly:</strong><br>I am so unbelievably valuable. Every cell within me is filled with light.</p>
                <p>Now visualize a golden light above your head. Let it wash over you—soft, warm, luminous. Let it move through your entire body, filling you with love and healing.</p>
                <p>Stay in this space for a few moments, letting this energy integrate into every layer of your being. Know that you are worthy of all the love, joy, and abundance that flows your way.</p>
              
                <h3>Closing Intention</h3>
                <p>Bring one hand to each shoulder, then gently rest both hands over your heart. Breathe in your strength. Exhale into your groundedness.</p>
                <p>Now, rise into movement one last time—light, joyful, free. Dance if you wish, knowing you are radiant, supported, and whole.</p>
                <p>This journey is yours. Trust in your body’s wisdom. You are enough, exactly as you are.</p>
