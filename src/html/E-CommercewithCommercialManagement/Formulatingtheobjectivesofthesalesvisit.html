            <h2>Lesson 4: Formulating the objectives of the sales visit</h2>

           <p>In this module, we will explore a series of effective techniques and practical methods designed to enhance your sales performance. These are not mere "magic formulas," but well-tested methodologies that, when applied correctly, can yield significant results. In the world of sales, as in business, there is no universal right or wrong—what matters is identifying strategies, tactics, and approaches that resonate with your style and experience. Some techniques will come more naturally to you, while others may require more effort. The key is to refine and adapt these methods in a way that aligns with your professional identity.</p>

<p>The techniques we will discuss are proven to work across various industries and regions. However, the real power of these methods comes with consistent practice and experience. Many successful salespeople already apply these techniques unconsciously. Whether you're aware of them or not, intentionally incorporating them into your daily practice will lead to measurable improvements in your sales outcomes. As the famous golfer Gary Player once said, "The more I practice, the luckier I get." Similarly, by preparing your business visits using these methods, you will become more efficient, achieving better results from each interaction while reducing effort.</p>

<p>The first fundamental mistake in sales is approaching meetings without a clear objective. As the Cheshire Cat advises Alice in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, "If you don’t know where you're going, any road will take you there." In sales, this lack of direction can lead you down paths that ultimately yield no significant results. To avoid this pitfall, it's crucial to prioritize your client meetings based on where they stand in the sales funnel. Regardless of CRM data or directives from your zone coordinator, no one understands your clients better than you.</p>

<p>Before you schedule a meeting, ask yourself: <em>When will this client be ready to make a purchase?</em> If they are not ready yet, it may be best to hold off and focus on clients who are primed for a decision. Similarly, consider the level of influence you have on this prospect—if they’re in the middle of the funnel, it may not be the right time to push for a sale. Should you focus on closing the deal now, or is it more beneficial to invest your time in a client who is ready to buy?</p>

<p>Salespeople often balance two types of visits: one aimed at developing the client relationship and guiding them through the funnel, and another focused on closing sales to meet short-term targets or quotas. The balance between these visits should be determined by your current performance against your quota and your preparation for the next period. However, never neglect your future quotas while closing current deals—successful sales professionals know that in order to harvest, they must first sow.</p>

<p>Once you've determined which client to visit and your goals for the meeting, it’s essential to prepare for all potential outcomes. Many salespeople default to aiming for a direct sale, but what if that isn't achievable? Should you walk away empty-handed? To avoid such an outcome, it’s vital to develop alternative plans—Plan B and even Plan C.</p>

<p>To ensure that you get the most out of every client meeting, I recommend using a simple four-stage framework, which we’ll refer to as GAIN: <em>Goal, Asset, Information, and Next Steps</em>.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Start by defining clear objectives for the meeting. Having only one objective is risky, as it leaves you vulnerable if that goal isn’t achieved. Instead, set three levels of objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Optimistic Objective</strong>: The ideal scenario, such as closing the sale or surpassing your initial target.</li>
  <li><strong>Conservative Objective</strong>: A realistic goal based on your experience and knowledge of the customer’s history.</li>
  <li><strong>Exit Objective</strong>: A fallback goal to ensure that even if the meeting doesn't result in a sale, it still provides value—such as addressing technical objections or gaining insight into the customer’s future needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Asset</h2>
<p>This refers to the resources or tools you will use to achieve your objective. These could include product demonstrations, case studies, or success stories from similar clients. Your asset is what will help you build trust and communicate the value of your solution.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>
<p>Remember, effective sales are built on reciprocal exchange. Use open-ended questions to gather valuable insights about your client’s needs and challenges. The more you understand their situation, the better you can tailor your offering. This stage is crucial for building rapport and laying the groundwork for a successful close.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Finally, review the outcomes of the meeting against your initial objectives. Based on what you've accomplished, define the immediate next steps. If you’ve addressed all objections, it may be time to move towards closing the sale. If you only achieved your exit objective, then set up a follow-up meeting or propose a new action, such as sharing additional information or scheduling a customer testimonial.</p>

<p>In summary, always enter a meeting with a clear plan and multiple objectives, ensuring that you are prepared for any outcome. The best improvisation is one that is carefully prepared, and by applying the GAIN methodology, you can maximize the impact of every client interaction.</p>
