            <h2>Lesson 2: Who can be a good salesperson?</h2>
            <p>In the world of e-commerce and commercial management, an exceptional salesperson is not just one who can close deals—they are problem solvers who genuinely address customer challenges. But how can we get customers to openly share their real pain points? There are three key principles that drive customers to open up about their true problems. Let's explore them.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, a successful salesperson is not necessarily someone with an extroverted personality, someone who can effortlessly charm any customer, or as the saying goes, "sell ice to Eskimos." Nor is it someone with a more introverted personality who listens attentively and takes copious notes but lacks initiative. Research has shown that there is no significant difference in business outcomes between extroverted and introverted sales profiles. In fact, studies demonstrate that salespeople who possess a flexible and adaptable style—often described as having an ambidextrous personality—perform far better. These individuals know how to switch between extroverted and introverted approaches, tailoring their interactions to align with each customer’s unique personality. Such adaptability can enhance sales performance by up to 80%.</p>

<h2>Mastering the Power of Questions</h2>

<p>The second critical trait of an effective salesperson is the ability to ask the right questions. Those who know how to ask engage in conversations that not only extract valuable information but also clarify the customer's needs. Asking the right questions helps confirm details, unearth hidden requirements, and ultimately allows us to position our offerings in a way that resonates with the customer. A well-paced series of questions keeps the dialogue flowing smoothly and productively.</p>

<p>There are two types of questions every salesperson should master:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Open-ended questions</strong>, which begin with words like “what,” “how,” “where,” and “why,” encourage customers to elaborate and share detailed insights. For example, “What are the key events you are planning to attend with this dress?”</li>
  <li><strong>Closed-ended questions</strong>, typically starting with a verb, allow for confirmation of specific facts. For example, “Do you have many orders scheduled for this quarter?”</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is to use these two types of questions strategically. Starting a conversation, diagnosing customer needs, or confirming product details each requires a different combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions.</p>

<h2>Cultivating Empathy: The Secret to Building Strong Relationships</h2>

<p>The third cornerstone of effective sales is empathy—the ability to connect with customers and understand their emotions. While some individuals may be naturally more empathetic than others, this is a skill that can always be improved. Empathy involves actively listening to the customer and reflecting their feelings back to them. This not only fosters a deeper connection but also creates an environment where customers feel comfortable sharing their true needs and concerns.</p>

<p>Here are a few simple ways to enhance your empathetic approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maintain eye contact and smile</strong> while engaging with the customer. These simple gestures can put the customer at ease and establish rapport.</li>
  <li><strong>Listen attentively</strong> and take notes on relevant details, whether personal or professional. Remembering small things, such as a client’s upcoming promotion, milestone achievements, or even their pet’s name, can make a significant impact on the relationship.</li>
  <li><strong>Address the customer by their name.</strong> People appreciate hearing their name—it’s a subtle yet powerful way to show that you’re paying attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Dress appropriately</strong> for the occasion. If you’re meeting with a corporate client, a suit and tie may be appropriate; if you’re dealing with a more informal client, such as a mechanic, dressing down is more fitting.</li>
  <li><strong>Value the customer’s input</strong> and bring up common topics that can bridge the gap between you, such as shared experiences or interests, whether related to family, hobbies, or geographical backgrounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that customer behavior can provide critical clues to their emotional state. For example, crossed arms or legs often signal distrust or defensiveness. In these cases, an empathetic approach—focused on building trust—can help the customer feel more comfortable, making them more open to engaging in meaningful discussions.</p>

<h2>Adapting to the Customer’s Needs: Building Trust First</h2>

<p>The goal of any sales interaction should not be to push a product immediately, but rather to build trust and rapport. A client who appears open and confident will be more willing to speak freely, and when they do, your role is to listen carefully, ask open-ended questions to dig deeper, and confirm their needs through closed-ended questions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if a client is more reserved, it’s your responsibility to take the initiative. Start with general questions, gradually building a level of trust and confidence as the conversation unfolds. Active listening and note-taking will be invaluable in these situations, allowing you to follow up with more specific inquiries based on the information they share.</p>

<h2>Sales: A Methodical Skill, Not an Innate Talent</h2>

<p>It’s essential to remember that the science of selling is rooted in methodical strategies rather than innate personality traits. The modern salesperson can learn and master the techniques that lead to success. Developing the three key skills—adaptability, questioning techniques, and empathy—will enable you to forge lasting relationships with customers, gain a deeper understanding of their true needs, and ultimately offer solutions that resonate and drive value.</p>

<p>Whether these qualities come naturally or not, anyone with the desire to learn can refine them. Mastering these skills will not only improve your ability to engage customers, but also increase your overall sales performance and foster long-term business growth.</p>
